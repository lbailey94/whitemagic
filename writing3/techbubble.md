# DOTCOM vs AI BUBBLES:

This is a marathon, not a sprint!

> **Common DNA:** positive gross margins, repeat-use product, sticky ecosystem, and just-enough capital.

| “Picks & shovels” win in every rush. | GPU makers, custom AI-cloud (CoreWeave), synthetic-data tools. 
| Build or back infrastructure with durable demand and pricing power. |

| Network effects & switching costs matter. 
| Platforms that integrate deeply into dev ops stacks (e.g., VS-Code-embedded copilots) or industry-specific data loops. 
| Aim for lock-in via workflows & data flywheels, not just model weights. |

| Cash discipline beats burn-rate bragging. | Rising compute bills mean gross-margin stress for pure-API startups. 
| Charge early, iterate with paying pilots, keep opex lean. |

| Over-capacity eventually commoditizes. 
| Today’s cloud GPU scarcity may flip to surplus circa 2027 when new fabs and exascale data centers come online. 
| Avoid assuming forever-high rent for compute; hedge with efficiency R&D. |

| Leaders can be dethroned quickly. | Open-source + domain-specific small models = constant disruption risk. 
| Treat moats as temporary; invest in continuous innovation and ecosystem, not just model performance. |

| Regulation arrives late but bites. | Upcoming AI-safety, copyright & privacy rules parallel SOX & dot-com accounting reforms. 
| Build compliance & provenance into products from day 1. |


1. **Follow the cash, not the demo.** 

Ask: *Is someone paying for this today?* If revenue ≈ $0, demand proof the TAM converts at reasonable margins.  

2. **Check the compute P/L line.** 

Gross margin after model-inference fees should exceed 50 % for SaaS-like resilience.  

3. **Prefer “AI-inside” ↔ workflow control.** 

Verticals (radiology, legal discovery, chip design) where AI rewires an expensive process tend to stick.  

4. **Stress-test under a 50 % price-cut scenario.** 

When model-hosting costs fall and rivals under-price, will you still be alive?  

5. **Look for data or distribution moats.** 

Proprietary structured datasets, regulatory approvals, or embedded enterprise contracts beat bare-model startups.  

We really have seen this movie before: rapid tech adoption narrative → capital flood → over-build → shake-out → lasting giants that solved real problems profitably. If history rhymes, today’s enduring AI winners are likely to be:

- Capital-efficient infrastructure enablers. 
- Platforms with strong network effects & recurring revenue.  
- Deep vertical specialists embedding AI so thoroughly that customers can’t rip it out.

Conversely, single-feature “wow” apps without moats may echo Pets.com. 

Keeping an eye on unit economics, differentiation, and the inevitable regulatory turn will separate the Amazons from the Webvans.

SOME IDEAS:


| **Revenue now, not later** | Every idea starts with paying pilots (per-exam, per-dataset, per-GPU-hour). |

| **Compute line under control** | Either sell compute itself (1) or sell *efficiency* (5); vertical plays (3, 4, 8) pass cost along with mark-ups. |

| **Moats beyond model weights** | Proprietary data (3, 4, 8), compliance IP (2), hardware footprint (6), standards network (7). |

| **Regulatory or structural tailwind** | Rising ESG pressure (1), data-sovereignty laws (2), medical-imaging shortage (3), AI-safety & provenance rules (7). |

| **Resilience to price wars** | If GPU prices crash, (1) wins on volume; others hinge on sticky workflows or patented savings. |

1. **Start with a wedge that burns someone’s hair on fire.** (e.g., radiologists’ report overload or CFOs’ GPU sticker shock).  

2. **Build a cash-flow-positive core quickly.** Aim for ≤ 12 months to paid pilots; iterate with customer feedback.  

3. **Expand horizontally once flywheel spins.** Amazon moved from books → every SKU → AWS; your radiology co-pilot could become a full-stack imaging platform, then branch into pathology.  

4. **Keep R&D in-house, infrastructure shared.** Your proprietary engine (synthetic-data simulator, inference compiler, provenance ledger) is the “secret sauce.” Everyone else rents it via APIs.  

5. **Bet on open-weights gravity.** Assume high-quality base models become commodity; your differentiator is *how* they are deployed, fine-tuned, governed, and integrated.


| **1** | **Carbon-aware GPU cloud for SMEs** 

| Start-ups can’t afford hyperscaler on-demand prices; CFOs hate opaque bills. | • Pay-as-you-go GPU minutes scheduled into “carbon-cheap” slots<br>• Reserved-capacity subscriptions (SaaS MRR) | • Grid-carbon + spot-price arbitrage IP<br>• Long-term PPAs for green energy<br>• Developer SDK that tags jobs with CO₂ budget → switching costs | Infrastructure “pick & shovel”; cash-flow from day 1; leverages over-capacity once today’s GPU shortage flips to glut citeturn0news28turn0search0 |



| **2** | **Regulated-data LLMOps platform** 

| Banks, pharma, and governments can’t ship data to public clouds. | • On-prem + sovereign-cloud deployment kits<br>• Per-token or per-seat license + support contract | • Compliance library (HIPAA, FINRA, GDPR, etc.) updated continuously<br>• Certified audit trail & watermark chain | Regulation creates high switching costs; policy risk becomes your moat. |



| **3** | **Radiology “AI co-pilot OS”** 

| Radiologists drown in report writing; staffing shortages. | • Per-exam fee (1–2 $ / study)<br>• Upsell analytics dashboard | • Proprietary fine-tuning on 100 M+ labeled images (partnerships with hospital networks)<br>• Workflow embed in PACS → sticky | Vertical generative-AI leaders like Rad AI are already revenue-positive citeturn0search1 |



| **4** | **Synthetic-data-as-a-Service for robotics & AV** 

| Gathering real-world corner cases is slow, risky, costly. | • Annual subscription for scenario libraries<br>• Custom dataset generation projects | • Procedural world engine + domain-randomisation IP<br>• Feedback loop from customers’ telemetry | Data moat (sim + real), high gross margin; demand grows as edge-AI proliferates citeturn0search5 |



| **5** | **Inference-efficiency R&D foundry** 

| Model-hosting costs eat 40-70 % of Gen-AI gross profit. | • Patent licensing for compression / distillation tricks<br>• Consulting retainers to re-architect models | • Deep bench of compiler / hardware ML scientists<br>• Library of auto-distillation recipes (e.g., 20× cheaper per token) | Survives price wars because it *sells* cost-savings; royalty upside scales with industry size. |



| **6** | **Edge-AI micro-server + ops stack for retail & warehouses** 

| Camera analytics in stores needs sub-100 ms latency; cloud roundtrip too slow / costly. | • Ruggedised ARM box (one-off sale) + monthly model-update subscription | • Hardware–software bundle; retrains on anonymised event logs (data moat) | Sticky recurring revenue, picks-and-shovels for the physical world. |



| **7** | **Content authenticity & provenance network** 

| Deepfakes, generative spam → trust deficit for media & regulators. | • API that embeds cryptographic provenance & watermarks at creation<br>• Per-asset fee for publishers & camera OEMs | • Consortium ledger + standards participation (C2PA etc.)<br>• Network effects: verifier ecosystem grows faster than imitators | Locked-in position once adopted by newswires, camera makers, social platforms. |



| **8** | **Multimodal graph search for enterprise knowledge** 

| Fortune-500 staff waste hours hunting for the “right” file / call / spec. | • Per-seat SaaS; charges for indexing TBs & secure LLM queries | • Proprietary graph of embeddings + metadata lineage<br>• Plug-ins for Slack, Office 365, Jira → high friction to rip-and-replace | Clear productivity ROI; data gravity protects margins. |
