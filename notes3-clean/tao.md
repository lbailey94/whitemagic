TAO

Gǎnyìng is a Chinese word meaning a "correlative resonance" pulsating throughout a purported force field of qi that infuses the cosmos. 

When the idea of ganying first appeared, it referred to a cosmological principle of "stimulus and response" between things of the same kind, analogous with vibratory sympathetic resonance.

Early schools of Chinese philosophy adapted ganying into different folk theories of causality, such as universal resonance influencing all interrelated things in Daoism, and ethical resonance between Heaven and humans in Confucianism. 

Ganying resonance was later used to mean miraculous "moral retribution" in Chinese folk religion, and "prayers being heard" in Chinese Buddhism. In the modern period, Chinese ganying "stimulus and response" was used to translate some Western scientific loanwords (such as diàncí gǎnyìng 電磁感應 "electromagnetic induction").
The Chinese collocation gǎnyìng combines gǎn 感 "feel, sense; move, touch; (traditional Chinese medicine) be affected (by cold)" and yìng traditional 應 or simplified 应 "respond; consent, comply; adapt to; cope/deal with; apply, applied", which is also pronounced yīng "promise/agree (to do something); answer; respond; (auxiliary) should; ought to".[1]
Several early texts (below) use an interchangeable synonym of ying < Old Chinese *[q](r)əәŋ 應 "respond; resonate" : dòng < *[Cəә-m-]tˤoŋʔ 動 "move; shake; set in motion". Dong can mean ganying, for instance, gǎndòng 感動 "move; touch (somebody)" and dòngrén 動人 "arouse interest/feelings". Sharf says interpreting the Chinese philosophical term gan "stimulus; affect; etc." is rendered problematic by the modern distinction between ontology and epistemology.[2] The ontological range of meanings, insofar as to gan someone is to effect the mind of another person, as evident in the (c. 121 CE) Shuowen jiezi dictionary definition of gan as 動人心也 "to move a person's mind", suggesting English translation equivalents such as "incite," "agitate," "rouse," and "stimulate". The epistemological range of gan meanings, insofar as it implies an inner experience or cognition that may or may not correlate with an event in the external world, is translatable as to "feel," "experience," "sense," or "become aware of."
Both the logographs gǎn 感 and yìng 應 are classified as radical-phonetic characters written with the "heart-mind radical" 心 (typically used to write words for feelings and thoughts) and phonetic indicators of xián 咸 "all; Hexagram 31" and yīng 鷹 "hawk; eagle" minus the "bird radical" 鳥.[3]
The history of ganying spans over two millennia, going from an ancient cosmological theory to modern scientific terminology.
Ancient texts use string resonance or sympathetic vibration between paired Chinese musical instruments as the most common analogy for (gan)ying "cosmic resonance". The Zhuangzi, Lüshi chunqiu (twice), Huainanzi (twice), and Chuci all mention plucking the classical pentatonic gong 宮 and jue 角 notes on the se 瑟 "a 25-string zither"; but the Chunqiu fanlu mentions the gong and shang 商 notes on either the se or qin 琴 "a 7-string zither". Joseph Needham notes both these instruments are commonly mistranslated as "lutes", but are actually "zithers", describing the qin as "a half-tube zither" and the se (which only survives in the descendent zheng 箏) as "a horizontal psaltery".[13] In modern terms of the solmization stave, gong, shang, and jue correspond to do, re, and mi. Click here to hear the gong "Original Tuning", shang "Sharpened Re Tuning", and jue "Lowered Third-string Tuning" on the Chinese zither.
The earliest records of ganying are in Chinese classics from the late Warring States period (475-221 BCE), when the "Hundred Schools of Thought" developed competing philosophical doctrines, including correlative resonance.
In the (c. 4th-3rd century BCE) Yijing "Classic of Changes", the "Commentary on the Decision" for Hexagram 31 Iching-hexagram-31.svg Xian 咸 "Influence (Wooing)" uses ganying 感應 to explain the Old Chinese phonetic connection between *[g]ˤr[əә]m 咸 "all; everywhere" and *kˤ[əә]mʔ 感 "move emotionally".
INFLUENCE [咸] means stimulation [感]. The weak is above, the strong below. The forces of the two stimulate and respond [感應] to each other, so that they unite. Keeping Still and joyousness. The masculine subordinates itself to the feminine. Hence it is said: "Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune." Heaven and earth stimulate each other, and all things take shape and come into being. The holy man stimulates the hearts of men, and the world attains peace and rest. If we contemplate the outgoing stimulating influences, we can know the nature of heaven and earth and all beings.[14]
Le Blanc says the roots for the "key notion" of resonance can be traced back to the older strata of the Yijing, citing an early saying preserved in Hexagram 1 Qian 乾's line interpretation.[15]
Nine in the fifth place means: "Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man." What does this signify? The Master said: Things that accord in tone vibrate together [同聲相應, repeated in Zhuangzi below]. Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another [同氣相求]. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. Thus the sage rises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows it kind.[16]
The (c. 400 BCE) Xiaojing "Classic of Filial Piety" has a section named Ganying 感應, translated as "The Influence of Filial Piety and the Response to It" (Legge)[17] or "Feeling and Responding by the Sprits" (Feng). It begins with an explanation of how the gods and spirits respond to human activities,
The Master said, "Anciently, the intelligent kings served their fathers with filial piety, and therefore they served Heaven with intelligence. They served their mothers with filial piety, and therefore they served Earth with discrimination. They pursued the right course with reference to their (own) seniors and juniors, and therefore they secured the regulation of the relations between superiors and inferiors (throughout the kingdom). When Heaven and Earth were served with intelligence and discrimination, the spiritual intelligences displayed (their retributive power)." (16)[18]
The (3rd century BCE) Confucian classic Xunzi repeats the above Yijing folk-etymology that the xian < *[g]ˤr[əә]m hexagram is the phonetic in the character for gan 感 < *kˤ[əә]mʔ "stimulate' influence".
The hexagram Xian, "All", of the Changes shows the relation of husband to wife. The Way of relations between husband and wife cannot be allowed to be incorrect, for it is the root source for the relations between lord and minister, father and son. The hexagram Xian [咸] means "influence" [感]. It uses the high to descend to the low, the male to descend to the female. It is weak and pliant above and strong and hard below." (27.38)[19]
The Xunzi uses ganying "joint resonance" to explain the harmonious connection between a person's xing 性 "inborn nature" and jing 精 "essence; senses".
These are the common names that apply to man. That which is as it is from the time of birth is called the nature of man [性]. That which is harmonious from birth, which is capable of perceiving through the senses and of responding to stimulus spontaneously [精合感應] and without effort, is also called nature [性]. The likes and dislikes, delights and angers, griefs and joys of the nature are called emotions [情]. When the emotions are aroused and the mind makes a choice from among them, this is called thought [慮]. (22)[20]
The (c. 3rd-2nd centuries BCE) Daoist classic Zhuangzi contains an early version of the zither string resonance analogy, which Sharf describes as undoubtedly "the single most persuasive demonstration of the principle of resonance".[21]
Zhuangzi tells the story to his friend Huizi in order to explain that the five predominant schools of philosophy, Confucianism, Mohism, Yangism, School of Names, and "Pingism" [uncertain]), merely debate like the five notes of the pentatonic scale, while Daoism contains and transcends them like an untuned note that resonates all 25 strings of the se 瑟 zither.
"Well, then," said Master Chuang, "there are the four schools of the Confucians, the Mohists, the Yangists, and the Pingists. Adding yours, master, it makes five. Which of you is actually right? Or may it be someone like Hasty Ninny [Lu Ju 魯遽]? His disciple said to him, 'I have attained your way, master. In winter I can light a cooking fire under a three-legged vessel and in summer I can make ice'. 'That's merely to attract [召] yang with yang and yin with yin'; said Hasty Ninny. 'It's not what I mean by the Way. I will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed one of them in the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note do [宮] on one, do resonated [動] on the other, and when he plucked the note mi [角] on one, mi resonated [動] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [動] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" (23)[22]
One Zhuangzi context uses gan with ying: "The sage walks with heaven in life and evolves with things in death. In stillness, he shares the same integrity as yin; in movement, he shares the same current as yang. He is not the founder of fortune, nor is he the initiator of misfortune. He responds [應] when affected [感], moves when pressed, and arises only when he has no other choice. He rids himself of knowledge and precedent, conforming to the principle of heaven." (15)[23]
Two others use ying to describe acoustic resonance: "Similar categories follow each other [同類相從] and similar sounds respond to each other [同聲相應]. Indeed, this is the principle of heaven." (31)[24] "To one who does not dwell in himself, the forms of things will manifest themselves. His movement is like water, his stillness is like a mirror. His response is like an echo [其應若響], indistinct as though it were absent, quiet as though it were pure." (33)[25]
Two chapters of Lü Buwei's (c. 240 BCE) wide-ranging Lüshi chunqiu "The Annals of Lu Buwei" repeat the ying 應 "acoustic resonance" zither-string analogy, and explain how phenomena that are of the same lei 類 "kind; category" mutually zhao 召 "resonate; attract" one another.
Things belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers [qi 氣] naturally join together; and notes that are comparable naturally resonate [應] to one another. Strike the note gong [宮] on one instrument and other strings tuned to the gong note will vibrate [應]; strike the note jue [角] and other strings tuned to the jue note will vibrate [應]. Water flowing across leveled earth will flow to the damp places; light evenly stacked firewood, and the fire will catch where it is driest. Clouds above a mountain look like shrubs; above water they resemble fish scales; above an arid landscape they look like leaping fire; above a flood they resemble rolling waves. Without exception, everything manifests signs that show men it shares the same category with that which creates it. Thus, "use the dragon to bring rain, and use a form to pursue a shadow. Wherever an army has camped, brambles and briars are sure to grow." The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny, but how could they know its true source? (13.2)[26]
Things belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers naturally join together; and musical notes that are close naturally resonate with one another [應]. Thus, strike the note gong [宮] on one instrument, and other strings tuned to the note gong will respond [應], or strike the note jue [角], and the other strings tuned to the note jue will vibrate [動]. Use the dragon to bring rain, Use a form to pursue a shadow. The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny; but how could they know its true source? Hence, when a state is in disorder, it does not merely remain in disorder but attracts bandits. Were it only to remain disordered, it would not necessarily perish; but since it attracts bandits, there is no means by which it could survive. (2.40)[27]
Xinzhong Yao's encyclopedia of Confucianism[28] defines ganying as "a mutual resonance or mutual sympathy between two or more phenomena", and says that in the Lüshi chunqiu, "the actions of the ruler elicit certain responses from Heaven, which are manifested through omens. In this system of resonances, the depth of the sovereign's moral cultivation is directly proportional to the prosperity of the realm." The ancient Chinese view that anomalies in the heavens, disturbances on earth, earthquakes, avalanches, sightings of unusual animals, and other such "wonders" (怪) were omens of the king's behavior has been termed "phenomenalism" by Western sinologists.[29]
During the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), scholars and philosophers adapted the notion of ganying into different fields. For Han cosmologists, ganying was important in both human-cosmos and state-cosmos correspondences. During the Han era, Henderson says both imperial ideology and political criticism rested on a world view shaped by correlative cosmology, which facilitated the wide dissemination of correlative modes of thinking among members of the politically-engaged Han elite.[30]
Like sounds harmonize together [同音者相]; Creatures mate with their own kind. The flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his friends. If you strike gong, then gong responds [應]; If you hit jue, then jue vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes; The dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying.[31]

The Chunqiu Fanlu "Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals", which is attributed to the Confucianist Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BCE) but compiled later, describes how humans are in a system of relationships with the cosmos, and elevates the notion of resonance to "a full-fledged cosmological theory".[32] This concept was called tian-ren ganying 天人感應 "resonance between Heaven and humans", a phrase that first appears in the (3rd-century CE) Book of Wei history of Emperor Cao Pi (r. 220-226), and was later used as the title of another text attributed to Dong Zhongshu: "Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind". Dong Zhongshu is sometimes credited with having formalized the doctrine of ganying and giving it classical expression.[33]
If water is poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards those that are wet. If (two) identical pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [qi] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [應]. The experimental proof [驗] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The kung [宮] note or the shang [商] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [應] the kung or the shang notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous [神], but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [數] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary way in which a thing of the same class responds [類之相應而起也] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer [應], and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [應]. When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is. . . It is not only the two [qi] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [進退] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves [而物以類應之而動者也] ... (As I said) when the note kung is struck forth from a lute, other kung strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) [應]; a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [此物之以類動者也]. They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [自鳴]. And wherever there is a mutual reaction [相動] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [自然]. But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, we know. So also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1)[34]

RUNNING A STATE BY THE TAO


Tao is the beginning of the myriad things, the standard of right and wrong. 

That being so, the intelligent ruler, by holding to the beginning, knows the source of everything, and, by keeping to the standard, knows the origin of good and evil. 

Therefore, by virtue of resting empty and reposed, he waits for the course of nature to enforce itself so that all names will be defined of themselves, and all affairs will be settled of themselves. 

Empty, he knows the essence of fullness: reposed, he becomes the corrector of motion. 

Who utters a word creates himself a name; who has an affair creates himself a form. 

Compare forms and names and see if they are identical. 

Then the ruler will find nothing to worry about as everything is reduced to its reality.

Hence the saying: "The ruler must not reveal his wants. For, if he reveals his wants, the ministers will polish their manners accordingly. The ruler must not reveal his views. For, if he reveals his views, the ministers will display their hues differently." 

Hence another saying: "If the like and hate of the ruler be concealed, the true hearts of the ministers will be revealed. If the experience and wisdom of the ruler be discarded, the ministers will take precautions." 

Accordingly, the ruler, wise as he is, should not bother but let everything find its proper place; worthy as he is, should not be self-assumed but observe closely the ministers' motivating factors of conduct; and, courageous as he is, should not be enraged but let every minister display his prowess. 

So, leave the ruler's wisdom, then you will find the ministers' intelligence; leave the ruler's worthiness, then you will find the ministers' merits; and leave the ruler's courage, then you will find the ministers' strength. 

In such cases, ministers will attend to their duties, magistrates will have definite work routine, and everybody will be employed according to his special ability. Such a course of government is called "constant and immutable".

Hence the saying: "So quiet, it rests without footing; so vacant, it cannot be located." 

Thus, the intelligent ruler does nothing, but his ministers tremble all the more. 

It is the Tao of the intelligent ruler that he makes the wise men exhaust their mental energy and makes his decisions thereby without being himself at his wits' end; that he makes the worthy men exert their talents and appoints them to office accordingly without being himself at the end of his ability; and that in case of merits the ruler gains the renown and in case of demerit the ministers face the blame so that the ruler is never at the end of his reputation. 

Therefore, the ruler, even though not worthy, becomes the master of the worthies; and, even though not wise, becomes the corrector of the wise men. 

It is the ministers who do the toil; it is the ruler who gets the spoil. 

This is the everlasting principle of the worthy sovereign.

Tao exists in invisibility; its function, in unintelligibility. 

Be empty and reposed and have nothing to do - 
Then from the dark see defects in the light. 

See but never be seen. 
Hear but never be heard. 
Know but never be known.
 
If you hear any word uttered, do not change it nor move it but compare it with the deed and see if word and deed coincide with each other. 

Place every official with a censor. 
Do not let them speak to each other. 
Then everything will be exerted to the utmost. 

Cover tracks and conceal sources. 
Then the ministers cannot trace origins. 
Leave your wisdom and cease your ability. 
Then your subordinates cannot guess at your limitations.

Keep your decision and identify it with the words and deeds of your subordinates. 
Cautiously take the sword and whip of reward and punishment and hold them fast. 
Uproot others' want of them, smash others' thought of them, and do not let anybody covet them. 

If the ruler is not cautious of the locking the cage or if he does not keep the door in good repair, the tiger will come out. 

If the ruler does not take precautions for his sway or if he does not cover his realities, the traitor will make his appearance. 

Who murders the sovereign and takes his place and finds the whole people side in awe with him, is called a tiger.

Again, who serves the country by the sovereign's side and watches for his secret faults with villainous motives, is called a traitor. 

Scatter his partisans, arrest his supporters, lock up the gate, and deprive him of all assistance. 
Then there will be no tiger in the country. 

Be too great to be measured, be too profound to be surveyed, identify norms and names, scrutinize laws and manners, and chastise those doing as they please. 
Then there will be no traitor in the country.

For these reasons, the lord of men always has to face five kinds of delusion: 
delusion by ministers impeding the sovereign, 
delusion by ministers controlling public resources and revenues, 
delusion by ministers issuing decrees at random, 
delusion by ministers distributing personal favours, and delusion by ministers feeding dependents. 

When ministers impede the sovereign, the sovereign loses his viewpoint. 
When they control public resources and revenues, he loses his advantages. 
When they issue decrees at random, he loses his ruling authority. 
When they distribute personal favours, he loses his name. When they feed their dependents, he loses his supporters. 

All their doings as such should be based on the initiative of the lord of men and should not be started by the ministers at their pleasure.

The Tao of the lord of men regards tranquillity and humility as treasures. 

Without handling anything himself, he can tell skilfulness from unskilfulness; without his own concerns of mind, he can tell good from bad luck. 

Therefore, without uttering any word himself, he finds a good reply given; without exerting his own effort, he finds his task accomplished. 

Whenever a reply is given to his question, he holds to its covenant. 

Whenever any task is accomplished, he holds to its result.

And out of coincidence and discrepancy between the consequences of tasks accomplished and the covenants of words uttered reward and punishment are born. 

Therefore, when a minister utters a word, the ruler should according to the word assign him a task to accomplish, and according to the result of the accomplishment call the task to account. 

If the result corresponds with the task and the task with the word, the minister should be rewarded. 

If the result corresponds not with the task and the task not with the word, he should be censured. 

It is in accordance with the Tao of the intelligent ruler that every minister should utter no word that corresponds not with its proper task.

For this reason, the intelligent ruler, in bestowing rewards, is as benign as the seasonable rain that the masses profit by his graces; in inflicting punishments, he is so terrific like the loud thunder that even divines and sages cannot atone for their crimes. 

Thus the intelligent ruler neglects no reward and remits no punishment. 

For, if reward is neglected, ministers of merit will relax their duties; if punishment is remitted, villainous ministers will become liable to misconduct. 

Therefore, men of real merit, however distant and humble, must be rewarded; those of real demerit, however near and dear, must be censured. 

If both the reward of the distant and humble and the censure of the near and dear are infallible, the distant and humble will not go idle while the near and dear will not turn arrogant.

No country is permanently strong. 
Nor is any country permanently weak. 
If conformers to law are strong, the country is strong; if conformers to law are weak, the country is weak.

King Chuang of Ching annexed as many states as twenty-six and extended his territory as far as three thousand li. 
As soon as King Chuang passed away from the Altar of the Spirits of Land and Grain, Ching decayed accordingly. 

Duke Huan of Ch`i annexed as many states as thirty and extended his territory as far as three thousand li. 
As soon as Duke Huan passed away from the Altar of the Spirits of Land and Grain, Ch`i decayed accordingly. 

King Hsiang of Yen took the Yellow River as state-boundary on the south, established the capital at Chi, doubled the defence works at Cho and Fang-ch`êng, smashed the Ch`i State, and subdued the Central Hills State, in such wise that whoever was a friend of Yen was respected and whoever was not a friend of Yen was despised. 

As soon as King Hsiang passed away from the Altar of the Spirits of Land and Grain, Yen decayed accordingly. 
King An-li of Wey attacked Yen, rescued Chao, took the land to the east of the Yellow River, and completely conquered both T`ao and Wei. 

Then he mobilized his troops into Ch`i and took the city of P`ing-lu to be his holiday resort. 

Then he attacked Han, took Kuan, won the battle by the Ch`i River. 

Then in the engagement at Chü-yang he drove the worn-out troops of Ching into retreat. 

Finally in the engagement at Shang-ts`ai and Chao-ling he routed the Ching troops. 

In this manner he sent out his expeditionary forces in the four directions throughout All-under-Heaven and spread his influence all over the countries of crowns and girdles. Following the death of King An-li, Wey decayed accordingly.

Thus, as long as King Chuang of Ching and Duke Huan of Ch`i were alive, Ching and Ch`i could remain hegemonic; 
as long as King Hsiang of Yen and King An-li of Wey were alive, Yen and Wey remained strong. 

Now their countries all fell into decay, because their ministers and magistrates all followed the path to chaos and never sought for the way to order. 

Though their countries were chaotic, they cast aside the state laws and schemed for nothing but their own outside interests. This was the same as to suppress a fire by carrying firewood on the back. 

Consequently confusion and weakness turned from bad to worse.

Therefore, at present, any ruler able to expel private crookedness and uphold public law, finds the people safe and the state in order; and any ruler able to expunge private action and act on public law, finds his army strong and his enemy weak. 

So, find out men following the discipline of laws and regulations, and place them above the body of officials.

Then the sovereign can not be deceived by anybody with fraud and falsehood. 

Find out men able to weigh different situations, and put them in charge of distant affairs. 

Then the sovereign cannot be deceived by anybody in matters of world politics.

Now supposing promotions were made because of mere reputations, then ministers would be estranged from the sovereign and all officials would associate for treasonable purposes. 

Supposing officials were appointed on account of their partisanship, then the people would strive to cultivate friendships and never seek employment in accordance with the law. 

Thus, if the government lack able men, the state will fall into confusion. 

If rewards are bestowed according to mere reputation, and punishments are inflicted according to mere defamation, then men who love rewards and hate punishments will discard the law of the public and practise self-seeking tricks and associate for wicked purposes. 

If ministers forget the interest of the sovereign, make friends with outside people, and thereby promote their adherents, then their inferiors will be in low spirits to serve the sovereign. 

Their friends are many; their adherents, numerous. 
When they form juntas in and out, then though they have great faults, their ways of disguise will be innumerable.

For such reasons, loyal ministers, innocent as they are, are always facing danger and the death penalty, whereas wicked ministers, though of no merit, always enjoy security and prosperity. 

Should loyal ministers meet danger and death without committing any crime, good ministers would withdraw.

Should wicked ministers enjoy security and prosperity without rendering any meritorious service, villainous ministers would advance. 

This is the beginning of decay.

Were such the case, all officials would discard legalism, practising favouritism and despising public law. 

They would frequent the gates of the residences of cunning men, but never once would they visit the court of the sovereign. 

For one hundred times they would ponder the interests of private families, but never once would they scheme for the state welfare of the sovereign. 

Thus, their subordinates, however numerous, are not for glorifying the ruler; the officials, however well selected, are not for serving the country. 

If so, the sovereign would have the mere name of the lord of men but in reality he simply commits himself to the care of the houses of the various ministers. Hence thy servant says: "The court of a decaying state has no man." 

That the court has no man does not imply the emptiness of the court. 

It means that private families strive to benefit one another but never seek to enhance the state welfare; 
that high officials strive to honour one another but never seek to honour the ruler; 
and that petty officials spend their salaries in cultivating personal friendships but never attend to their official duties.

The reason therefore is: The sovereign never makes his decisions in accordance with the law but always trusts in his subordinates for whatever they do.

Therefore, the intelligent sovereign makes the law select men and makes no arbitrary promotion himself. 

He makes the law measure merits and makes no arbitrary regulation himself. 

In consequence, able men cannot be obscured, bad characters cannot be disguised; falsely praised fellows cannot be advanced, wrongly defamed people cannot be degraded. 

Accordingly, between ruler and minister distinction becomes clear and order is attained. 
Thus it suffices only if the sovereign can scrutinize laws.

The wise man, on ministering to a ruler, faces the north and swears an oath of his office, pledging "not to have two minds, never to reject any low commission in the court, and never to reject any hard job in the military camp, but to follow the instructions of his superior, to obey the law of the sovereign and empty his mind so as to wait for the royal decrees to come, and to have no dispute about them". 

Therefore, though he has a mouth of his own, he never speaks for his own advantage; though he has eyes of his own, he never sees for his private interest. 

Both his mouth and eyes are kept under his superior's control. 

In other words, who ministers to a ruler may be likened to the hand that is able to care for the head upward and for the feet downward, never fails to relieve them from extremes of cold and heat, and never fails to strike away even the Mo-yeh Sword when it is near the body. 

Similarly, the intelligent ruler never employs worthy and clever ministers or wise and able men for any selfish purpose. 

Therefore, the people do not cross the village border to make friends and have no relatives living one hundred li away; high and low do not trespass against each other; the fool and the wise, each being content with his own lot, keep the scale and stand in perfect balance. 
Such is the crowning phase of order, indeed!

Now, those who make light of rank and bounties, resign from their offices and desert their posts with ease, and thereby choose their masters, thy servant does not call upright. 

Those who falsify theories, disobey laws, defy the sovereign, and make forcible remonstrances, thy servant does not call loyal. 

Those who bestow favours, distribute profits, win the hearts of inferiors, and thereby make names, thy servant does not call benevolent. 

Those who leave the world, retire from active life, and thereby reprove the sovereign, thy servant does not call righteous. 

Those who serve abroad as envoys to other feudal lords, exhaust the strength of the native country, and wait for the moment of crisis to molest the sovereign, saying, "the inter-state friendship, unless thy servant be in charge of it, cannot become intimate; the inter-state enmity, unless thy servant be in charge of it, cannot be appeased," and thereby aim to win the sovereign's confidence, to be trusted with state affairs, and to increase their influence by lowering the name of the sovereign and benefit their own families by hampering the resources of the country, thy servant does not call wise. 

These examples are common practices prevailing in the dangerous age, which the law of the early kings would weed out.

The law of the early kings said: "Every minister shall not exercise his authority nor shall he scheme for his own advantage but shall follow His Majesty's instructions. 
He shall not do evil but shall follow His Majesty's path."

Thus, in antiquity the people of an orderly age abode by the public law, discarded all self-seeking tricks, devoted their attention and united their actions to wait for employment by their superiors.

Indeed, the lord of men, if he has to inspect all officials himself, finds the day not long enough and his energy not great enough. 

Moreover, if the superior uses his eyes, the inferior ornaments his looks; if the superior uses his ears, the inferior ornaments his voice; and, if the superior uses his mind, the inferior twists his sentences. 

Regarding these three faculties as insufficient, the early kings left aside their own talents and relied on laws and numbers and acted carefully on the principles of reward and punishment. 

Thus, what the early kings did was to the purpose of political order. 

Their laws, however simplified, were not violated. 

Despite the autocratic rule within the four seas, the cunning could not apply their fabrications; the deceitful could not practise their plausibilities; and the wicked found no means to resort to, so that, though as far away from His Majesty as beyond a thousand li, they dared not change their words, and though as near by His Majesty as the courtiers, they dared not cover the good and disguise the wrong. 

The officials in the court, high and low, never trespassed against each other nor did they ever override their posts.

Accordingly the sovereign's administrative routine did not take up all his time while each day afforded enough leisure.

Such was due to the way the ruler trusted to his position.

Indeed, the minister trespasses against the sovereign in the court as in the lie of the land. 

Leading forward step by step, he makes the lord of men forget the starting-point until he turns from east to west and is not conscious of the change. 

To guard against such misleadings, the early kings set up the south-pointing needle to ascertain the directions of sun-rise and sun-set. 

Thus, every intelligent ruler ordered his ministers never to realize their wishes outside the realm of law and never to bestow their favours inside the realm of law; in short, never to commit any unlawful act. 

As strict laws are means to forbid extra-judicial action and exterminate selfishness and severe penalties are means to execute decrees and censure inferiors, legal authority should not be deputed to anybody and legal control should not be held behind the same gate. 

Should legal authority and control be kept in common by both ruler and minister, all varieties of wickedness would come into existence. 

If law is of no faith, its enforcement by the ruler is absurd.

If penalty is not definite, culprits cannot be overcome. 

Hence the saying: "The skilful carpenter, though able to mark the inked string with his surveying eyes and calculating mind, always takes compasses and squares as measures before his marking; the great genius, though able to accomplish his task with swift move, always takes the law of the early kings as the ruler before his accomplishment."

Thus, if the inked string is straight, crooked timbers will be shaved; if the water-level is even, high gnarls will be planed down. 

Similarly, if weights and balances are well hung up, what is too heavy will be decreased and what is too light will be increased; once pecks and bushels are established, what is too much will be decreased and what is too little will be increased.

Hence to govern the state by law is to praise the right and blame the wrong. 

The law does not fawn on the noble; the string does not yield to the crooked. 

Whatever the law applies to, the wise cannot reject nor can the brave defy. 

Punishment for fault never skips ministers, reward for good never misses commoners. 

Therefore, to correct the faults of the high, to rebuke the vices of the low, to suppress disorders, to decide against mistakes, to subdue the arrogant, to straighten the crooked, and to unify the folkways of the masses, nothing could match the law. 

To warn the officials and overawe the people, to rebuke obscenity and danger, and to forbid falsehood and deceit, nothing could match penalty. 

If penalty is severe, the noble cannot discriminate against the humble. 

If law is definite, the superiors are esteemed and not violated. 

If the superiors are not violated, the sovereign will become strong and able to maintain the proper course of government. 

Such was the reason why the early kings esteemed legalism and handed it down to posterity. 

Should the lord of men discard law and practise selfishness, high and low would have no distinction



	
Chapter XV. Portents of Ruin1
1. As a rule, if the state of the lord of men is small but the fiefs of private families are big, or if the ruler's sceptre is insignificant but the ministers are powerful, then ruin is possible.

2. If the ruler neglects laws and prohibitions, indulges in plans and ideas, disregards the defence works within the boundaries and relies on foreign friendship and support, then ruin is possible.

3. If all officials indulge in studies, sons of the family are fond of debate, peddlars and shopkeepers hide money in foreign countries, and poor people suffer miseries at home, then ruin is possible.

4. If the ruler is fond of palatial decorations, raised kiosks, and embanked pools, is immersed in pleasures of having chariots, clothes, and curios, and thereby tires out the hundred surnames and exhausts public wealth, then ruin is possible.

5. If the ruler believes in date-selecting, 2 worships devils and deities, believes in divination and lot-casting, and likes fêtes and celebrations, then ruin is possible.

6. If the ruler takes advice only from ministers of high rank, refrains from comparing different opinions and testifying to the truth, and uses only one man as a channel of information, then ruin is possible.

7. If posts and offices can be sought through influential personages and rank and bounties can be obtained by means of bribes, then ruin is possible.

8. If the ruler, being easy-going, accomplishes nothing, being tender-hearted, lacking in decision, and, wavering between acceptance and rejection, has no settled opinion, then ruin is possible.

9. If the ruler is greedy, insatiable, attracted to profit, and fond of gain, then ruin is possible.

10. If the ruler enjoys inflicting unjust punishment and does not uphold the law, likes debate and persuasion but never sees to their practicability, and indulges in style and wordiness but never considers their effect, then ruin is possible.

11. If the ruler is shallow-brained and easily penetrated, reveals everything but conceals nothing, and cannot keep any secret but communicates the words of one minister to another, then ruin is possible.

12. If the ruler is stubborn-minded, uncompromising, and apt to dispute every remonstrance and fond of surpassing everybody else, and never thinks of the welfare of the Altar of the Spirits of Land and Grain but sticks to self-confidence without due consideration, then ruin is possible.

13. The ruler who relies on friendship and support from distant countries, makes light of his relations with close neighbours, counts on the aid from big powers, and provokes surrounding countries, is liable to ruin.

14. If foreign travellers and residents, whose property and families are abroad, take seats in the state council and interfere in civil affairs, then ruin is possible.

15. If the people have no 3 confidence in the premier and the inferiors do not obey the superiors while the sovereign loves and trusts the premier and cannot depose him, then ruin is possible.

16. If the ruler does not take able men of the country into service but searches after foreign gentlemen, and if he does not make tests according to meritorious services but would appoint and dismiss officials according to their mere reputations till foreign residents are exalted and ennobled to surpass his old acquaintances, then ruin is possible.

17. If the ruler disregards the matter of legitimacy and lets bastards rival legitimate sons, or if the sovereign dies before he inaugurates the crown prince, then ruin is possible.

18. If the ruler is boastful but never regretful, makes much of himself despite the disorder prevailing in his country, and insults the neighbouring enemies without estimating the resources within the boundaries, then ruin is possible.

19. If the state is small but the ruler will not acquiesce in a humble status; if his forces are scanty but he never fears strong foes; if he has no manners and insults big neighbours; or if he is greedy and obstinate but unskilful in diplomacy; then ruin is possible.

20. If, after the inauguration of the crown prince, the ruler take in a woman from a strong enemy state, the crown prince will be endangered and the ministers will be worried. Then ruin is possible.

21. If the ruler is timid and weak in self-defence and his mind is paralysed by the signs of future events; or if he knows what to decide on 4 but dare not take any drastic measure; then ruin is possible.

22. If the exiled ruler is abroad but the country sets up a new ruler, or if before the heir apparent taken abroad as hostage returns, the ruler changes his successor, then the state will divide. And the state divided against itself is liable to ruin.

23. If the ruler keeps near and dear to the chief vassals whom he has disheartened and disgraced or stands close 5 by the petty men 6 whom he has punished, then he will make them bear anger and feel shame. If he goes on doing this, rebels are bound to appear. When rebels appear, ruin is possible.

24. If chief vassals rival each other in power and uncles and brothers are many and powerful, and if they form juntas inside and receive support from abroad and thereby dispute state affairs and struggle for supreme influence, then ruin is possible.

25. If words of maids and concubines are followed and the wisdom of favourites is used, and the ruler repeats committing unlawful acts regardless of the grievances and resentments inside and outside the court, then ruin is possible.

26. If the ruler is contemptuous to chief vassals and impolite to uncles and brothers, overworks the hundred surnames, and slaughters innocent people, then ruin is possible.

27. If the ruler is fond of twisting laws by virtue of his wisdom, mixes public with private 7 affairs from time to time, alters laws and prohibitions at random, and issues commands and orders frequently, then ruin is possible.

28. If the terrian has no stronghold, 8 the city-walls are in bad repair, the state has no savings and hoardings, resources and provisions are scarce, and no preparations are made for defence and attack, but the ruler dares to attack and invade other countries imprudently, then ruin is possible.

29. If the royal seed is short-lived, new sovereigns succeed to each other continuously, babies become rulers, and chief vassals have all the ruling authority to themselves and recruit partisans from among foreign residents and maintain inter-state friendship by frequently ceding territories, then ruin is possible.

30. If the crown prince is esteemed and celebrated, has numerous dependents and protégés, develops friendships with big powers, and exercises his authority and influence from his early years, then ruin is possible.

31. If the ruler is narrow-minded, 9 quick-tempered, imprudent, easily affected, and, when provoked, becomes blind with rage, then ruin is possible.

32. If the sovereign is easily provoked and fond of resorting to arms and neglects agricultural and military training but ventures warfare and invasion heedlessly, then ruin is possible.

33. If nobles are jealous of one another, chief vassals are prosperous, seeking support from enemy states and harassing the hundred surnames at home so as to attack their wrongdoers, but the lord of men never censures them, then ruin is possible.

34. If the ruler is unworthy but his half-brothers are worthy; if the heir apparent is powerless and the bastard surpasses him; or if the magistrates are weak and the people are fierce; then the state will be seized with a panic. And a panic-stricken state is liable to ruin.

35. If the ruler conceals his anger, which he would never reveal, suspends a criminal case, which he never would censure, and thereby makes the officials hate him in secret and increases their worries and fears, and if he never comes to know the situation even after a long time, then ruin is possible.

36. If the commander in the front line has too much power, the governor on the frontier has too much nobility, and if they have the ruling authority to themselves, issue orders at their own will and do just as they wish without asking permission of the ruler, then ruin is possible.

37. If the queen is adulterous, the sovereign's mother is corrupt, attendants inside and outside the court intercommunicate, and male and female have no distinction, such a régime is called "bi-regal". 10 Any country having two rulers is liable to ruin.

38. If the queen is humble but the concubine is noble, the heir apparent is low but the bastard is high, the prime minister is despised but the court usher is esteemed, then disobedience will appear in and out of the court. If disobedience appears in and out of the court, the state is liable to ruin.

39. If chief vassals are very powerful, have many strong partisans, obstruct the sovereign's decisions, and administer all state affairs on their own authority, then ruin is possible.

40. If vassals of private families are employed but descendants of military officers 11 are rejected, 12 men who do good to their village communities are promoted but those who render distinguished services to their official posts are discarded, self-seeking deeds are esteemed but public-spirited works are scorned, then ruin is possible.

41. If the state treasury is empty but the chief vassals have plenty of money, native subjects are poor but foreign residents are rich, farmers and warriors have hard times but people engaged in secondary professions are benefited, then ruin is possible.

42. The ruler who sees a great advantage but does not advance towards it, hears the outset of a calamity but does not provide against it, thus neglecting preparations for attack and defence and striving to embellish himself with the practice of benevolence and righteousness, is liable to ruin.

43. If the ruler does not practise the filial piety of the lord of men but yearns after the filial piety of the commoner, does not regard the welfare of the Altar of the Spirits of Land and Grain but obeys the orders of the dowager queen, and if he allows women to administer the state affairs and eunuchs to meddle with politics, then ruin is possible.

44. If words are eloquent but not legal, the mind is sagacious but not tactful, the sovereign is versatile but performs his duties not in accordance with laws and regulations, then ruin is possible.

45. If new 13 ministers advance when old officials withdraw, the unworthy meddle with politics when the virtuous pass out of the limelight, and men of no merit are esteemed when hard-working people are disdained, then the people left behind will resent it. If the people left behind resent it, ruin is possible.

46. If the bounties and allowances of uncles and brothers exceed their merits, their badges and uniforms override their grades, and their residences and provisions are too extravagant, and if the lord of men never restrains them, then ministers will become insatiable. If ministers are insatiable, then ruin is possible.

47. If the ruler's sons-in-law and grandsons live behind the same hamlet gate with the commoners and behave unruly and arrogantly towards their neighbours, then ruin is possible.

Thus, portents of ruin do not imply certainty of ruin but liability to ruin.

Indeed, two Yaos 14 cannot rule side by side, nor can two Chiehs 15 ruin each other. The secrets of rule or ruin lie in the inclination towards order or chaos, strength or weakness.

It is true, the tree breaks down because 16 of vermin, the fence gives way on account 17 of cracks. 

Yet, despite the vermin, if no sudden gale blows, the tree will not break down; despite the cracks, if no heavy rain falls, the fence does not give way.

If the sovereign of ten thousand chariots can exercise tact and enforce law and thereby function as gale and rain to rulers having portents of ruin, his annexation of All under-Heaven will have no difficulty.




Thy servant, therefore, says: If measures for political order are clarified, the state, though small in size, will become rich. 

If reward and punishment are dignified and of faith, the people, though small in number, will become strong. 

If reward and punishment follow no regulations, the state, however large in size, will have weak soldiers. 

For the soil is no longer its territory, the people no longer its subjects. 

Without territory and people, even Yao and Shun never could reign supreme nor could the three dynasties 33 ever become strong. 34

For illustration, if the mirror keeps clean and has no obstacle, then the beautiful and the ugly can be compared; 
if the balance keeps right and has no obstacle, then the light and the heavy can be weighed. 

Indeed, when you shake the mirror, the mirror cannot keep clear; when you shake the balance, the balance cannot keep even. 

The same is true of the law. Therefore, the early kings took Tao as the constant standard, and the law as the basis of government.




Things have their respective principles and therefore cannot trespass against each other. 

Inasmuch as things have their respective principles and therefore cannot trespass against each other, principles 57 are determinants of things and everything has a unique principle. 

Inasmuch as everything has its unique principle and Tao disciplines the principles of all things, everything has to go through the process of transformation. 

Inasmuch as everything has to go through the process of transformation, it has no fixed frame. 

Since everything has no fixed frame, the course of life and death depends upon Tao, the wisdom of the myriad kinds conforms to it, and the rise and fall of the myriad affairs is due to it. 

Heaven can be high because of it, earth can hold everything because of it, the Polar Star can have its majesty because of it, the sun and the moon can make constant illumination because of it, the five constant elements 58 can keep their positions constant because of it, all the stars can keep their orbits right because of it, the four seasons can control their diverse expressions because of it, Hsien-yüan could rule over the four directions at his discretion because of it, Master Red Pine 59 could live 60 as long as heaven and earth because of it, and sages can compose essays and elaborate institutions because of it. 

It was manifested in the wisdom of Yao and Shunm in the rampancy of Chieh-yü, 61 in the destruction of Chieh and Chow, and in the prosperity of T`ang and Wu. 

Near as you might suppose it to be, it travels to the four poles of the world. 
Far as you might suppose it to be, it always abides by the side of everybody. 
Dim as you might suppose it to be, its gleam is glittering. 
Bright as you might suppose it to be, its body is obscure. 

By its achievement heaven and earth are formed. 
By its harmony thundering is transformed. 

Thus everything in the world owes it its formation. 

By nature the inner reality of Tao is neither restrained nor embodied. 

It is either soft or weak according as the occasion is, and is always in correspondence with principles. 

Because of it everything dies. Thanks to it everything lives. 

Because of it every affair fails. Thanks to it every affair succeeds. 

Tao can be compared to water. 
Who is drowning, dies as he drinks too much of it. 
Who is thirsty lives on as he drinks a proper amount of it. 

Again, it can be compared to a sword or a spear. 62 
If the stupid man uses it for wreaking his grudge upon others, calamities will happen. 
If the saintly man uses it for punishing the outrageous, good luck will ensue. 
Thus, people die of it, live owing to it, fail because of it, and succeed on account of it.




Hence the saying: "Skilful deception is not as good as unskilful sincerity." For instance, Yo Yang despite his merit incurred suspicion while Ch`in Hsi-pa despite his demerit increased his credit.

Once upon a time, a man of Lu, who was a good maker of sandals, and whose wife was a good weaver of gloss-silk, was about to migrate to Yüeh. 

Thereupon someone said, "You are bound to become poor there!"

"Why?" asked the man. "Because sandals are for the feet to wear, but the Yüehs go bare-footed. 

Gloss-silk is for making crowns, but the Yüehs dishevel their hair. 

With your skill unemployed in that country, how can you help becoming poor?"



If every one in the world will love universally; states not attacking one another; houses not disturbing one another; thieves and robbers becoming extinct; emperor and ministers, fathers and sons, all being affectionate and filial -- if all this comes to pass the world will be orderly. 

Therefore, how can the wise man who has charge of governing the empire fail to restrain hate and encourage love? 

So, when there is universal love in the world it will be orderly, and when there is mutual hate in the world it will be disorderly. 
This is why Mozi insisted on persuading people to love others.

	
This is true even among thieves and robbers. As he loves only his own family and not other families, the thief steals from other families to profit his own family. 

As he loves only his own person and not others, the robber does violence to others to profit himself. And the reason for all this is want of love. 

This again is true in the mutual disturbance among the houses of the ministers and the mutual invasions among the states of the feudal lords. 

As he loves only his own house and not the others, the minister disturbs the other houses to profit his own. As he loves only his own state and not the others, the feudal lord attacks the other states to profit his own. 

These instances exhaust the confusion in the world. 

And when we look into the causes we find they all arise from want of mutual love.

When nobody in the world loves any other, naturally the strong will overpower the weak, the many will oppress the few, the wealthy will mock the poor, the honoured will disdain the humble, the cunning will deceive the simple. 

Therefore all the calamities, strifes, complaints, and hatred in the world have arisen out of want of mutual love. 
Therefore the benevolent disapproved of this want.

Mozi said: Partiality is to be replaced by universality. But how is it that partiality can be replaced by universality? 

Now, when every one regards the states of others as he regards his own, who would attack the others' states? Others are regarded like self. 

When every one regards the capitals of others as he regards his own, who would seize the others' capitals? Others are regarded like self. 

When every one regards the houses of others as he regards his own, who would disturb the others' houses? Others are regarded like self. 

Now, when the states and cities do not attack and seize each other and when the clans and individuals do not disturb and harm one another -- is this a calamity or a benefit to the world? 
Of course it is a benefit. 

When we come to think about the several benefits in regard to their cause, how have they arisen? 

Have they arisen out of hate of others and injuring others? 
Of course we should say no. 

We should say they have arisen out of love of others and benefiting others. 

If we should classify one by one all those who love others and benefit others, should we find them to be partial or universal? 
Of course we should say they are universal. 

Now, since universal love is the cause of the major benefits in the world, therefore Mozi proclaims universal love is right. 

And, as has already been said, the interest of the magnanimous lies in procuring benefits for the world and eliminating its calamities. 

Now that we have found out the consequences of universal love to be the major benefits of the world and the consequences of partiality to be the major calamities in the world; this is the reason why Mozi said partiality is wrong and universality is right.

When we try to develop and procure benefits for the world with universal love as our standard, then attentive ears and keen eyes will respond in service to one another, then limbs will be strengthened to work for one another, and those who know the Dao will untiringly instruct others. 

Thus the old and those who have neither wife nor children will have support and supply to spend their old age with, and the young, weak and orphans will have the care and admonition to grow up in. 

When universal love is adopted as the standard, then such are the consequent benefits. 

It is incomprehensible, then, why people should object to universal love when they hear it.

But how do we know Heaven desires righteousness and abominates unrighteousness? 

For, with righteousness the world lives and without it the world dies; with it the world becomes rich and without it the world becomes poor; with it the world becomes orderly and without it the world becomes chaotic. 

Heaven likes to have the world live and dislikes to have it die, likes to have it rich and dislikes to have it poor, and likes to have it orderly and dislikes to have it disorderly. 

Therefore we know Heaven desires righteousness and abominates unrighteousness.

Heaven abominates the large state which attacks small states, the large house which molests small houses, the strong who plunder the weak, the clever who deceive the stupid, and the honoured who disdain the humble - these are what the will of Heaven abominates. 

On the other hand, it desires people having energy to work for each other, those knowing the way to teach each other, and those possessing wealth to share with each other

There are those who love the people and benefit the people,
and obey the will of Heaven and obtain reward from Heaven. 

There are also those who hate the people and oppress the people,
and oppose the will of Heaven and incur punishment from Heaven.




'The ancients of old wished for nothing and the world had enough; they did nothing and all things were transformed.

The stillness of the sages does not belong to them as a consequence of their skilful ability; all things are not able to disturb their minds - it is on this account that they are still. 

When water is still, its clearness shows one's reflection.
It  is a perfect Level, and the greatest artificer takes his rule from it.
 
Such is the clearness of still water, and how much greater is that of the human Spirit! 

The still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the reflection of all things.
Vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action - this is the Level of heaven and earth, and the perfection of the Dao and its characteristics. 

Therefore the Dis, Kings, and Sages found in this their resting-place. 

Resting here, they were vacant; from their vacancy came fullness; from their fullness came the distinctions (of things). 

From their vacancy came stillness; that stillness was followed by movement; their movements were successful. 

From their stillness came their non-action. 
Doing-nothing, they devolved the cares of office on their employ, Doing-nothing was accompanied by the feeling of satisfaction.

Where there is that feeling of satisfaction, anxieties and troubles find no place; and the years of life are many.


The Sage walks the Way of Heaven in life, 
and evolves with the Way of Earth in death. 

In stillness, they share the same integrity as yin; in movement, they share the same current as yang.
 
Their movement is like water, their stillness like a mirror, their response like an echo, indistinct as though it were absent, quiet as though it were pure.

When water is still, its clarity shows one's reflection.
Such is the clarity of still water, and how much greater is that of the human Spirit! 


To one who does not dwell in themselves, the forms of all things will manifest themselves.


When all the world recognizes beauty as beauty, this in itself is ugliness; when all the world recognizes good as good, this in itself is evil. 

Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth to each other;
Difficult and easy compliment each other;
Long and short exhibit each other;
High and low set measure to each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Back and front follow each other.

Return to the root and you will find the meaning;
Pursue the light, and you will lose its source;
Look within, and in an instance, you will conquer the manifest and the void.

All perceptions and beliefs come from mistaken views.
There is no need to seek truth, only stop having views.

Be empty, still, and sit in repose - 
Then, from the dark, see all that is revealed in the light. 

See without being seen,
Hear without being heard,
Move without being moved,
Know without being known.

This is the Way of Heaven and Earth.



The Secret of the Golden Flower..


#第一章 天心 (The “Heavenly Heart”)
The opening sets the frame: “turning the light around” (回光) is the core method. “Light” is the innate awareness that “lodges” between the two eyes (sun and moon), in the “square-inch field” (寸田尺宅) called the Heavenly Heart. Practice means resting the light there—simple, direct, and “entirely a reverse method.” It insists the art needs both nimbleness and deep stillness. 
8bei8.com

#第二章 元神、識神 (Original spirit vs. conscious mind)
It distinguishes 元神 (yuan-shen, original spirit) from 識神 (shi-shen, discursive consciousness). Using the triad “essence-water, spirit-fire, intent-earth,” the work links breath, attention, and vitality; turning the light “refines the hun, restrains the po,” letting true yang arise and the “sacred embryo” form naturally—no forcing. The imagery makes the point vivid: as dung beetles roll a pellet and life emerges, so the Heavenly Heart can gestate the subtle body. 

#第三章 回光守中 (Turning the light and keeping to the center)
Method, not mystique: begin with steady sitting; within ~100 days the light becomes genuine “spirit-fire.” Reverse the habitual outward flow; use the “nose-tip” as a practical gauge to keep the eyes half-lowered, preventing scattering or dullness. “Stopping and seeing” (止觀) are yoked: stop = returning, seeing = illumination; both together are the work. 

#第四章 回光調息 (Turning the light with breath regulation)
Two early obstacles: restlessness and drowsiness. The fix is “listening to the breath” so softly that you hear its silence—breath becomes subtle, mind grows clear, and “true breath” shows itself. The text uses “ear-light” and “eye-light” as paired levers; inner seeing/hearing cures dullness without strain. 

#第五章 回光差謬 (Common missteps)
Don’t fall into blank, inert “nothingness” (a dead void), and don’t drift with proliferating thoughts or subtle visionary fascinations (the “skandha realm”). Either extreme derails the work—at worst into yin states the text likens to “fox-spirit” bypaths. The remedy: a lively clarity that lets go without collapsing, and practice that is alert, unforced, and unbroken. 

#第六章 回光證驗 (Verifications)
As practice matures, signs arise: pervasive warmth and ease; “a moon in mid-heaven,” a worldbright clarity; and “empty room generating white”—a luminous blank in which the body can feel buoyant. It also aligns these with classic visionary stages (e.g., Contemplation of Infinite Life motifs), but stresses that experiences vary; trust your own “cold-warmth” (felt sense). 

#第七章 回光活法 (Living method)
Keep your day job. The chapter teaches “mobile alchemy”: meet affairs with right attention so the light doesn’t get carried off; early-morning sits help, but the key is moment-to-moment “returning light” amidst life. Sustained for 2–3 months, the work “gains confirmation,” i.e., becomes self-validating. 

#第八章 逍遙訣 (The Free-and-Easy Formula)
A compact poem encodes the advanced move: center the Heavenly Heart, then “two eyes” act as the cosmic pivot (斗柄), guiding water-fire (坎離) to meet. You learn to catch the “living midnight” (活子時)—the spontaneous ignition of true yang—and cycle phases within a single session (“one section contains three sections”), all without strain. The text unpacks this in precise, practical imagery. 

#第九章 百日築基 (Hundred-day foundation)
“After one hundred days the light is genuine.” This is not a calendar fetish; “one breath is a hundred days” when intent and spirit unify. The point is steady gain—day strengthens night and night strengthens day—until true yang emerges by itself and the subtle “infant” is set. No willful tinkering. 

#第十章 性光識光 (Original light vs. cognitive light)
This is a sharp, almost phenomenological chapter. “Before differentiation it is xing-light (性光); with grasping it turns into shi-light (識光).” Don’t chase lights; use letting go to remain with uncontrived seeing. One of the text’s punchiest lines sits here: “When the mind is quiet, that is the elixir; when the mind is empty, that is the medicine.” 

#第十一章 坎離交媾 (The intercourse of Water and Fire)
A precise map: leaking out through the seven orifices is “Li”; gathering inward and silently containing is “Kan.” Turning the breath back to its root is already the “true union”; formal sitting only deepens it. The identity chain is elegant: Kan/Li → yin/yang → nature/life → body/mind → spirit/breath. 

#第十二章 週天 (Circulation)
“Mind is the pivot; qi is the stars.” Don’t force or “harvest”—there is “no method of ‘gathering’.” When the center is steady, circulation (small or great) becomes natural, like the sky revolving around the unmoving pole. It clarifies the relation of the living midnight and the clock midnight: know both; seek the living spark whenever it shows.

The finale is a teaching-poem plus glosses: set the pivot (“玄關”), settle breath “between zi and wu” (a Kan/Li cue, not a clock), keep “mind still, breath settled” as the base; then “mind forgotten, breath congealed” → “breath stilled, mind empty” (elixir completed) → “mind-breath as one” (warming/raising) → “seeing nature” (Way real-ized). It cautions against overexerting the eyes (losing the light) and urges simple, faithful practice.
