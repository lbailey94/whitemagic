DREAMS, REALITY, SAMSARA


/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/


DREAMS 

Realize the dreamlike nature of Reality.

99.99% of tangible reality is made of lines and fields of energy and light.

These fundamental forces - gravity, electromagnetism, all that happens within the atom - are connected, and have the same origin.

Vibrations, frequencies, cymatics, harmonics, resonances, sacred geometry, divine numbers and golden ratios.

The Universe and everything within it is shaped by polarity, duality, harmony, opposition, balance, resonance, and rhyhtm.

The Stars and Planets affect conditions here on Earth;
The elements are connected to the Sun, Moon, and Stars;
One may augur the future by looking at the alignments of the stars and planets

"In sleep, the Soul seeks the activities of its true self..
Consciousness is sought by Man for his own diversion"
- Edgar Cayce

"Mind is the Builder; Knowledge not lived becomes sin.."


Pay attention to your dreams, keep a journal; all people across space and time are connected through dreams

Within the unconscious mind, there is no separation

All things are dreamed before they happen

No dream comes from nowhere

One can free themselves within a dream

a self, or being, is a conduit through which energy passes and is transformed.

Consciousness, dreams, psychic and paranormal phenomena, reincarnation, synchronicities, coincidences - all these things are connected.

Abandon dualism and absolutism; nothing is true, everything is permitted.


everything springs from and returns to its Source..

everything in the external world is the same, part of the same illusion; none of it objectively matters; everything is part of waking up


in the beginning was the word

divine mother as sita; allowing us to meet ourselves through divinity

divine mother as kali, the entire process of nature; she will always have more to teach

her other face is what you're trying to see; if she is illusion, she is also beyond illusion; when you leave her behind, she is waiting on the other shore

Separation is the greatest illusion; all things are connected
All separations, divisions, and comparisons are mistaken assumptions, temporary illusions.


at lower vibrations, condensed energy within food, water, and the air allows the Being to move and live, while higher vibrations allow it to create thoughts and feelings, and at the highest, allows for awareness and connection with the infinite.

once one no longer fully identifies with the physical plane, they can better access higher energies and states of being

as you vibrate higher, more energy becomes available to you, until you get to the point where you cease to exist and you become all energy

we exist simultaneously in all planes at all times, but usually can only focus on information coming from one at a time.

the universe is formed from the finest, etheric light; the highest plane is the clear light, which includes everything

the highest astral plane is yin and yang, but it's still polarity and duality

we are attached to this reality, to our thoughts and senses, and that's why most people can't remember past lives, or even their dreams

all form is drama; no matter, never mind, no mind, never matter

mind creates matter; the causal plane of ideas creates our universe; the idea that lies behind the universe is god

energy becomes form; causal, astral, and physical planes are all emanations and manifestations of yin and yang

Life is a Dream, and Death is only the changing of form, the world is a mirage - there is no beginning or end
Face Reality with fully open eyes.


the entire cosmos, at every plane, in every form, is energy

Nothing is permanent except change; form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

The processes of Creation are the Keys to Understanding.


"The Self appears through illusion as the World.."


"Thirty spokes converge upon a hub; it is the hole in the center that makes a wheel useful.
We make a vessel from a lump of clay; it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.
We make doors and windows for a room; it is the empty spaces that make the room liveable.

While the tangible has advantages, it is the intangible that makes these advantages useful."
All things under heaven are born of the corporeal; the corporeal is born of the incorporeal."

"Does anyone want to take the world and do what they want with it? I do not see how they can succeed.
The world is sacred, and must not be tempered with or grasped after. 
To tamper with something is to spoil it, to grasp something is to lose it.

'I know that I know, and that I don't know, but I forget;
I see that I am blind, and I see the blinding light in everything, but I forget;
I see what I know, I think I know what I see, but sometimes I forget;
And this is the Way it should be; at the end of every forget, I remember' - Lonny Brown


This world is like a stage, where men perform many parts under various disguises. They do not like to take off the mask, unless they have played for some time. Let them play for a while, and then they will leave off the mask of their own accord. 

- Ramakrishna

Thought is matter as much as the floor, the wall, the telephone, are matter. Energy functioning in a pattern becomes matter. That is all life is … Matter and energy are interrelated. The one cannot exist without the other, and the more harmony there is between the two, the more balance, the more active the brain cells are. Thought has set up this pattern of pleasure, pain, fear, and has been functioning inside it for thousands of years and cannot break the pattern because it has created it.
- Jiddu Krishnamurti


All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry that it is dark

This is no world. It is God Himself. In delusion we call it world.
- Swami Vivekenanda


___________________________________

REALITY


'If you set foot upon the path, you begin to see it everywhere' - Hermes T.

'none of the secrets of the world are secret; you're just not tuned to the right frequency yet'

"all that I knew, still wasn't enough"

"I had gone through game after game..still, people were looking into my eyes - 'Do you Know?'..'Do You?'..

'a new type of thinking is essential' - Albert Einstein

"As to foreknowledge, it is only the flower of Tao, and the beginning of folly."

"One who knows does not speak; one who speaks does not know."


Some aspects of reality can be grasped and comprehended by the Mind, but most of it is beyond its reach.

All that we can see and hear, all that we touch and experience, all that we think and dream of, is less than 1% of reality.

The Rational Mind is Not Enough.

what happens in meditation helps you in the world;
what happens in the world helps you in meditation;
both are the same place


all thoughts add to the illusion, when we reach the shore, we must leave the boat behind.


//


All things return to their origin;
To return to the origin is to find peace;
To find peace is to fulfill one's destiny;
To fulfill destiny is to become constant, like a star in the night sky;
To become like a star in the heavens is called Insight.

The way of a common man is to accumulate wealth and knowledge;
The way of a sage is to let go of wealth and knowledge.
Be done with learning, and you will no longer be vexed.
Accept that you can know nothing in certainty, and you will come to know everything.



To realize that all knowledge is ignorance is a noble insight;
To regard our ignorance as truth is delusion.


we worship rationality, logic, and science over spirit;
if you think you are free, you cannot escape your prison
no technology, no rules, no laws, nothing controlled or created by humanity can liberate humanity

All comparisons and divisions are mistaken assumptions.

psychedelics are a tool to awaken someone under specific circumstances, but they can only take you so far

our waking consciousness is just one of an endless number of realities
the only true reality includes all realities, and at the same time, is beyond them all

The truths of life cannot be communicated, only experienced.

Truth can only be found through our own exploration and discovery - it cannot be communicated or taught.


Sahaja means spontaneous enlightenment in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. 

Sahaja practices first arose in Bengal during the 8th century among yogis called Sahajiya siddhas.
Ananda Coomaraswamy describes its significance as "the last achievement of all thought", and "a recognition of the identity of spirit and matter, subject and object", continuing "There is then no sacred or profane, spiritual or sensual, but everything that lives is pure and void.

The master cannot take a single step for their student.

Be critical of all teachings; search for your own truth.

Look at Death with open eyes.


Mind over Matter

Mantras, the Sanskrit syllables inscribed on yantras, are essentially "thought forms" representing divinities or cosmic powers, which exert their influence by means of sound-vibrations.[6]





This world is like a stage, where men perform many parts under various disguises. They do not like to take off the mask, unless they have played for some time. Let them play for a while, and then they will leave off the mask of their own accord. - Ramakrishna


- recognize that the nature of reality is one in which everything is interconnected
- being open and receptive to the truth of all realities
- see beyond the boundaries of the physical world and the illusion of separation
- peel away the layers of illusion and begin to understand the greater truth of reality
- appreciate the interconnectedness of all of creation

MANA //

99.99% of tangible reality is made of intangible forces.


After conception, one begins to gather Mana, condensing it into matter, materializing it after the akashic, etheric body (neural crest cells).
Once one begins to form memories and feel emotions, Mana begins to pour out of the Heart, filling every cell.

Upon death, one ceases to make memories or react to the world around them, and Mana begins to leak away.
Decay does not occur until the Heart and Mind completely leave the body, taking whatever Mana is left with them.
Sudden and violent death leads to a confused spirit with great stores of Mana that will soon run out, while peaceful and gradual death leads to a coherent spirit that can ascend to higher realms, and subsist off of environmental ether.

All spirits borrow and collect Mana from the environment, even from sunlight. Malicious shades and vampires steal it from living beings.

Whenever one uses powers, abilities, or magic, their Heart reaches out, sending Mana along the Aka vines, influening and being influenced.

Suggestion, hypnotism, mesmerism, stunning, the Evil Eye, Hexes, all phenomena involve sending out Mana to create a desired effect.

Using breath, visualization, and physical movement, one can push in, circulate, and move Mana within and around the body.

Psychometry, scrying, telepathy, and remote viewing involve letting your Mana absorb energies and information, then pulling it back to you.
Heart to heart is fastest and best connection, but poses risks - most use crystal balls, mirrors, or other devices in order to safeguard themselves.

All nonliving things are capable of holding, sending, and recieving Mana.
All places have their own history and energy.

All matter is formed from condensed Mana in the imprint of its akasic form.

The Sun sends out the finest and thinnest form of Mana, traveling along its rays.

Likewise, stars and planets emit their own Mana, and so empty space is full of cosmic energies.

Life exists on Earth due to the concentration and transmutation of Mana throughout the circle of Life.

Mana, Ki, Qi, Orenda, Prana, whatever you may call it, is intelligent, and responds to direction and will.

Your own Heart can be given direction through Mana, by yourself and others, by intention or accident.

If Mana is water, and ideas are seeds, then Aka, the connections between all things, can be seen as roots and vines, growing with attention, and wilting with neglect, weaving together and crossing over each other.

In this way, two Minds can communicate, and two Hearts can feel one another.

Mana can be visualized like Water, capable of evaporating, freezing, being contained, leaking out, flowing along the path of least resistance.

One can pull in and store Mana using their own Aka.

Using Mana, one can create fields, channel energy, affecting things through solid matter and across distance and time.

The more people working in concert with the same intent, the more pronounced the effects become.

One can heal others with their own energies, but it is likely to harm the healer without proper preparation and precaution. Often, one enlists the aid of higher beings, calling on the Clear Light to channel through them.

Pray, accumulate Mana, and fast, before and after healing.

With enough Mana, Aka can make our desires, wishes, and prayers manifest.

All things require a certain amount of Mana to exist in our reality. 

Hypnotism and mesmerism involve using Mana, directed by the Mind, to act upon the Heart of another, often while they are relaxed or distracted.

Memories, beliefs, convictions, can all be brought forth, suppressed, or altered with enough Mana, and a stronger Mind and Will than the subject.

Negative and restrictive emotions cloud and block the circulation of Mana within the body, causing weakness, illness, and eventually, death.

Though the Heart channels vast oceans of Mana, it is the Mind that directs it towards its calling.

If Mana is water, then ideas are seeds, meant to be given care and attention.

Mana must be constantly in motion. If it becomes still, it begins to evaporate, and leak away. 

Ideas, thoughts, sigils, symbols, rituals, and objects are all ways of storing Mana over time.

Two people are connected always, so long as they think of one another.

Ku Mu Mana-o - for the Idea that I take, another I give.

You can connect with objects in order to charge them with Mana, influencing them and creating fields of force.

Doing this to yourself is the essence of Merkhaba.

Directing Mana passively involves prayer and wishes; actively involves magic, ritual, and psychic ability.

Actions and rituals move Mana, while names, objects, places, etc. contain and store it.

Enchantments and curses use one's Voice to carry Mana, while the Evil Eye uses the gaze; charms, hexes, and totems use objects and symbols.


Stone, water, paper, cloth, soil, blood, bone, wood, hair, all hold Mana and intention well.

Iron, glass, and other refined materials have difficulty.


///


CONNECTIONS, AKA, AKASA, ETHER, THE ASTRAL//

Interacting with something or someone establishes an Aka connection

Dreams can show you what is connected to you through Aka, the thoughts, intentions, and Hearts involved. 

We use matter to clothe and incarnate ourselves, but our true selves are etheric, energetic, akashic.

Our astral form is what allows us to heal, be healed, and travel through realities.

All beings are connected to one another and the Creator.



Dreams can even connect you to spirits, Wakanda, the higher realms, and the Creator.


When one jumps in their sleep, they are either coming or going from their body.

Sages, yogis, sanyasi, and other ascetics practice leaving the body at will, projecting the Hearts and Minds into their Astral body, and travelling across realities as conscious energy.

The Astral form travels through the Akasa, the sea of connections, allowing it to sense and experience all things.

All things, both tangible and intangible, have an akasic form.

Often, one connects to others unknowingly, through the Dreaming Realm.

Everything one experiences creates connections, which strengthen with attention, and fade with neglect. The more of a connection you have with someone, the easier it is to pass along telepathic and intuitive messages.

MAGIC, RITUAL, AND INTENTION // 

Anything that provokes emotion, carries great energy.

Thoughts are created things, connected to the thoughts and acts preceding and coming after them, becoming "Real" through time and effort.

If you believe something is easy or impossible, you are correct.

You create your reality!

By concentrating on a desire, it becomes real. Project your consciousness to a reality where your conditions are already met, and you will soon be there.


Using tangible parts of something in ritual drastically increases its power (voodoo, dark arts, death prayers, ritual cannibalism)

All forms of magic can be combined, altering, nullifying, or increasing effects.

The best and most common magical objects are those involved in work, warfare, music, and ritual - hammers, swrods, drums, pipes, masks..

Exposed and public charms have different effects and intention, compared to private or hidden charms.

In spring, most cultures celebrate renewal and fertility rituals; in summer, they fast and burn purifying fires; in autumn, they hold harvest festivals and honor the dead; in winter, they burn lights, spend time with family, and give thanks for another year.

Sympathetic magic is often the most direct and efficient, and is sometimes done on accident. "As I do X, Y happens..."


Telepathy is the most common form of magic and psychic ability.

Some people, places, objects, are resistant to connection, and cannot be easily viewed.
One can often only "read" another if they are distracted, unaware, busy, or, ideally, willing to make a connection.
Those who are aware, and resistant, cannot be read.

Like anything involving the Heart, one must still the Mind to receive impressions and messages.

Symbols, sigils, and signs have both personal and collective meanings.

Intention is everything - you cannot heal without convincing someone they need and deserve healing.

Lomi Lomi - 
Warm herbal bath, sun bathing, fire warmed stones, and laying of hands.

Consciousness directs energy through will, creating attractive and repulsive forces.

These forces travel along connections, binding currents and threads (quantum entanglement)

By shaping and using these forces, all things become possible - psychic and paranormal phenomena, magic, miracles, and healing.


Kuni Curse -
Burning one's hair, and throwing the ashes into the ocean.


AU MAKUA, WAKANDA, AND FREE WILL //


Au Makua, the Spirit Guardians, existing outside of space and time, all knowing and all powerful.

The Au Makua help to guide our souls into each incarnation, for reasons often kept unknown to our Waking Minds.

Our Free Will is so important, that they cannot help without our consent.

Through the Au Makua, energy, matter, and spacetime can be shaped, making all things possible.

If Two speak of the Spirit, then I am with them.

Our Free Will allows us to individually and collectively shape reality.

Free Will, spontaneity, learning, becoming, experience, are the most important aspects of existence, our reason for being here.

Anything that can be imagined can become real.

Through Life, the Creator experiences and expresses itself.

The process of growth and enlightenment will last endless lifetimes.

Free Will is necessary for development; every mistake is understood and forgiven, even as you make it.

The evolution of Life, consciousness, and technoloy are all reflections of one another.


Others may purposefully and accidentally do and say things that affect you deeply. Again, there are no coincidences - everything is part of your destiny and development.

Whatsoever you believe, it becomes true; whatsoever you believe about yourself, you are right.

Most bad things that happen to a person in their life are self-fulfilled prophecies, caused by the consequences of their own actions. 

The Wakanda unite lost Hearts and Minds, guiding them back together and into reincarnation.

All Souls are in their own individual stages of spiritual development.

As our collective consciousness elevates, more becomes possible.

All things act in an order, there are no coincidences in a universe of sacred cause and effect.

We choose to be born into specific families, situations, and lifetimes for our own growth and development, and to help others along the way.

Our Au Makua can help us at any time, if we invite them into our lives.

The Paiute and other Plains tribes knew the Au Makua as Wakanda, or the friend of the Soul.

The Wakanda can be asked for aid, such as sunshine and rain.

The Wakanda are the source of insight, enlightenment, miracles, psychic power, and intuition. The Heart and Mind open the Gates.

By connecting with the Au Makua, or Wakanda, the protector and guide spirits, we are capable of doing the impossible, and communicating with the infinite.


SPIRITS AND SUMMONING //

At seances, objects and even animals are dematerialized, brought great distances, and materialized at will, sometimes changing shape or form, becoming translucent or intangible, often retaining characteristics like heat and motion.
When the time is right, these things are often returned to where they came from.

Spirits and fae materialize at will, often in nature or in abandoned places. Ghost battlefields and will-o-wisps are common examples.

Spirits have said that the forces involved can be found all around us.

A spirit that helps a person is known as a Kala. They can be convinced, captured, or ideally, consent to help the individual. Some are passed down to apprentices.
Spirits often use ley lines to travel and communicate, which is why temples and important places are built over them.


Kalas can be employed in any number of ways - servants, teachers, protectors, friends, spies, messengers, thieves, assassins.
All they ask for is Mana, so they can do what is asked, and a preferred substance - often liquor, herbs, or fruit.

A spirit with no Mind has no reason, a spirit with no Heart has no memory.


Kalas, when sent to kill a target, often need something that is connected, such as hair, nails, or blood. They will search for a weakness, and once one is found, they will steal Mana until the being weakens, collapses, and dies, at which point they return with all of the Mana to the summoner.
Examples include the Anana Death Prayer and the Australian Bone Arrow.

The Heart and the energy it radiates is more than enough to protect one from Spirits and Shades. However, you cannot protect against yourself.
Fear, guilt, shame, grief, lies, delusions, and other negative emotions dim your light, creating openings for malicious spirits to come through, causing mental illness, weakness, madness, possession, and death.

Experienced Mediums and Summoners can ask spirits and shades to appear in our world, taking Mana and clothing themselves in borrowed matter.
All of these things are provided for by the summoner, the audience, and the environment. The more involved, the more can be done.


DEATH AND THE AFTERLIFE //

After death, the Heart and Mind often stay together, leading to one enjoying the Death Dream, meeting family and ancestors, and living in their chosen afterlife until they choose to explore higher realms, or their time to reincarnate arrives.

Some attain enlightenment during this in Life, while others wait until the death of the body.
Some abide in Nirvana, while others return to Samsara, either for their own enjoyment and development, and for the salvation and enlightenment of other beings.


If one's Heart and Mind begin to drift apart, they will be stuck in the realm of the Death Dream, interacting with us through manifestation, possession, and phenomena until they are guided to a better place.

One can willingly guide their own consciousness into a new or existing body, forcing instant reincarnation. 
If conditions are right, one who has died can be led back to their body.

The dead report that their after life is exactly as they expected. Whatsoever you believe will happen after death, is what happens.

The Realm of the Death Dream is the closest to our own world, and spirits there say they can still see and interact with us.

Our ancestors and the recent dead visit us often, guiding and protecting us. 
All those you wish to meet after death, you will see them again, as you did in life.

It would appear that, if Hell exists, it is personal, temporary, and likely necessary for one's continued growth and development.

Those that wish to transcend beyond the Death Dream may do so at any time, and those that wish to return to the cycle of Samsara, with or without memories, make the trip when they are ready, guided by the Au Makua, or Spirit Guardians.

THE DREAMING HEART AND THE WAKING MIND //

The Mind does not actively send or recieve messages, it only translates them to the waking consciousness, like recalling a memory.
The Heart connects to others, copies what it sees, and presents it back to you.

Memories, once formed by the Heart, are easy to recall, and can become a source of energy and inspiration. 

Creative, unique, and intelligent thought by the Mind takes energy, while sudden insight and inspiration is gifted by Wakanda.


The more relaxed the Mind becomes, the more clearly the Heart can express itself.

The Heart ignores the constant stream of noise from the Mind, but it pays attention to feelings, focus, actions, sensations. This is one of the Keys to Magic.

Whatsoever the Heart and Mind believe, either through emotional, rational, or ethical justifications - only certain people, places, and events can change them. 

The Heart and Mind reject what they do not believe, and meeting resistance, are more likely to bend and adapt, rather than break.

To see what someone believes in, look for what causes strong emotions and reactions.

The aversions and attractions one develops along the journey of life is a great part of one's personality.

To "break" a harmful or destructive habit or belief, they must be inspected by the Mind, and then it must be replaced with a different habit or belief, supplemented with great amounts of Mana and Will.

Positive experiences lead to positive fixations that drive one's growth, while negative experiences lead to negative fixations that lead to stagnancy and hesitation. In either case, powerful sensations are involved, creating influential memories within the Heart.

Distress, pain, and trauma can temporarily separate a Heart and Mind. This is usally bad, especially at the moment of death, but it can also save someone from malicious possession.

Children, having few fixations to cloud their Hearts and Minds, easily percieve spirits and fae, and can easily exercise their own powers and abilities, being capable of communicating with Wakanda while waking and dreaming.

Whatsoever comes to your mind without conscious effort - pay attention.

The Heart loves praise, and rewards patience. Treat yourself with kindness.

Memories, experiences, and personality do not die with the body, but go on with the Heart.

The Heart is the source of expression, capable of shaping energy and matter to show its intent.

Uhane, the Waking Mind; sentience, consciousness, curiosity, knowledge, reason, the direction of Will, the One that Speaks.

Unihipili, the Dreaming Heart; the treasury of memory, emotions, intuition, the source of power, the One who Listens.

Only under certain conditions does the Heart become prominent over the Mind, allowing the Heart to express itself freely. Trance, stupor, fugue, coma, hypnosis, sleepwalking, are all related.

All Hearts come from One Heart, All Minds are connected to the One Mind











The balance of inner and outer pressures create all of known existence; a tree within a seed, a bird within an egg, a universe within a flash of light.












神

DIVINITY 

Honor Creation, and the Creator.
Creator and Creation; Lover and Beloved.

There is only one Creator, that has created all things. 
Nothing exists outside of what the Creator has made. 
And so - we make peace with that Creator, and all Creation.
The air and clouds above, the snow, rain, hail, sleet, fog, lightning and thunder;
The earth beneath us, the fire, the water, the plants and animals, humankind;
Made in Circles, moving in Circles, Circles within Circles.

The Creator has placed power in all things;
And so we respect and revere all of Creation, even ourselves, and one another. 
We live a sacred existence, where all things are connected; there are no coincidences.

All phenomena, tangible and intangible things, all beings, are an emanation of the Creator, and are therefore sacred.

Embrace Earth and Heaven, follow the natural cycles of Life and Death.

All things are within the Circle, the Sacred Hoop.
The known universe, the galaxies, black holes, the stars, moons, and planets, all are formed in spheres and circles, and travel in circles and spirals.

The days, nights, and seasons move in circles; air, water, earth, and fire move in circles.

Birth, growth, transformation, decay, and death are a circle.


All beliefs, all paths, lead to the One.

Being sacred, every living and nonliving thing is a universe unto itself.

We share one world, one star, one galaxy, one reality. We are all family.

Trust in yourself, in others, in the world around you, in the Creator.
Faith is what makes change and miracles possible.

There is no reason to turn away from the material world, it is no less sacred. 
Turn towards the unseen, towards Spirit, not out of aversion to the mundane, but out of love for the Divine.

As the universe continues to expand and evolve, so does Life, and Consciousness.

"We are the universe experiencing itself"



All things have innate consciousness, the imprint of consciousness, being created from the First Consciousness, and therefore exist.

As it was in the beginning, so it will be in the end.


You are pure by nature; only your thoughts and beliefs are impure.



There is nothing real except the Creator;
All worlds and beings are part of the Great Spirit.

The Body is the Temple of the Most High.

Create within yourself a sacred place, of peace and stillness; find an altar there, ask any blessing, and it wil be given to you.


Going against Divine Law inbalances the elemental forces of Nature

All things, including healing, come from the Source, the Divine

The Soul is Eternal, we go out, and come in again

The Soul enters a living body of its own desire

Many souls reincarnate into the same family trees

"There needs to be, in one's life, knowledge of the power of God, and God's work in the affairs of mankind"
