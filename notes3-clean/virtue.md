DHARMA & VIRTUE


法

DHARMA 

Embrace each moment, live in blissful awareness, unconcerned with the past, the future, or with problems in the present, that always resolve themselves.

Always take the highest road, seek the highest view.

Practice patience, compassion, humility, mindfulness, gratitude, faith, optimism, sincerity. 

Seek joy, peace, understanding, love, purpose, wisdom, and balance.

Trust and rely on yourself, the ones you love, and the kindhearted stranger.

We must not define ourselves and others by our circumstances, or our capabilities, but by our character, our acts, and our shared journey towards joy and peace.

"Become a being of beauty and love."

Release all self-centered beliefs and behaviors, let go of all that burdens you, and holds you back.

Be critical of all teachings; search for your own truth.

We are uniquely gifted to shape our lives to our highest calling.
Use your gifts to share your truth, your light, what gives you joy - and in doing so, inspire others.

Express yourself in meaningful ways.

Rediscover yourself; become aware of your true potential.

You rise as high as your greatest aspiration, you sink as low as your most negative conception of yourself.

Free yourself from limiting and restrictive beliefs.

Life can be so much more, if we let it be.

We are unaware of our true potential, and the true nature of reality.

Belive in the impossible.

Prioritize your own happiness over others' expectations.

Never doubt or censor yourself.

Never compromise when it comes to yourself.

Recognize and break the cycles of familial, generational, and ancestral trauma placed upon you.

Our emotions become constructive only when we use them to create, to connect with ourselves and others.

If you wish for collective progress, focus on personal growth and development. 
"Let each restore their own clarity, then nature and all the world will be restored."

Only when we have reclaimed our sovereignty and power as individuals, can we come together and change our world.

"Free your Mind, and Your Ass will Follow...
The Kingdom of Heaven is within."

Our potential is limitless; we have the power to create and manifest all that we imagine and desire, to shape our lives to our highest calling.

Perception is Reality; unhappiness, discontent, disappointment, stem from our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, surrounding ourselves, others, and the world around us.

Our beliefs can either be our greatest source of suffering, or our greatest source of joy.

You only lose what you cling onto; you only fail when you truly give up

There is nothing outside of yourself that will give you joy, peace, purpose, or understanding; you can only find them within.

Restore balance between your inner and outer lives.

Reconnect with yourself, with others, your community, your ancestors, nature, the spirits, and the Creator.

Heal and inspire yourself, and you can do the same for others.

The Body is the Temple of the Most High.

Create within yourself a sacred place, of peace and stillness; find an altar there, ask any blessing, and it wil be given to you.

"Just as a potter shapes a vessel to perfection, so does a wise person shape their mind.

Like a fish taken from water and cast on land, so does the mind flutter, due to the temptations of the world.

A harnessed mind brings great happiness.
A wise person should pay attention to their mind.
It is subtle, and wanders where it pleases.

One who cannot control their mind will never attain true wisdom, lives an imbalanced life, has wavering faith.

The heart of a fully conscious person is fearless.
Free of desire and hate, they have transcended good and evil.

Observe this body, as fragile as an earthen vase.
Perfect the mind, then confront temptation with the weapon of insight, and proceeding without attachment, guard what you have already conquered."

"There is no suffering for one who has completed the journey, who is free of sorrows and all else, who has broken all chains.

The mindul do not remain content, and leave their homes behind, like swans leaving a drying lake.

Arahants, focused on deliverance and emptiness, having no obsessions, leaves no trace, like the path of birds through the sky.

Even the devas delight in the presence of they who have liberated themselves.

They are as accepting as the Earth, as firm as a mountain, as quiet as a lake.

Whoever has reached freedom through wisdom is peaceful, unshakable, nonviolent in thought, speech, and action.

Delightful is nature, where worldly people find no joy.
Being free of desire, sages who seek no pleasure find joy in these places."

"First, one must establish their principles, before preaching to others. There must be no gap in credibility, no disgrace.

Let one mold themselves in accordance with the precepts they teach.

Only self shelters self. What shelter is there outside the self?

Hurting yourself and others is easy.
Healing yourself and others is difficult.

By one's self is evil done, by one's self is one made impure.
By one's self is evil undone, by one's self is one made pure.
Each person is responsible for themselves.
No one can save another.

One should not neglect themselves for the sake of another.
One must learn first before teaching.
Let each person embrace their own truth, and devote themselves to its fulfillment."

It is difficult to be born human. It is difficult to live life as a human being.
Rare is the opportunity to hear the Dharma, even more rare is the appearance of an enlightened one.

To shun all evil, to do good, to purify one's heart - this is the teaching of the enlightened ones.

Patience that is enduring is the best discipline.

A shower of gold cannot satisfy craving, painted cakes do not satisfy hunger.

Threatened with danger, many go to gardens, sacred mountains and forests. But these places are not the Supreme Refuge.
Take refuge in the teachings of the enlightened ones, within one's self."

"When anyone mistakenly pursues only what is pleasant, avoiding the true path, forgetting their true purpose...whenever they another on the true path, they experience loss and regret.

Avoid attachment to attraction and repulsion.
Do not cling to what is pleasant; let it pass, so that the separation will not diminish you.

Holding onto what is dear causes hesitation, fear, and sorrow.

Sorrow and fear spring from affection, sensual pleasure, and desire.

The fruits of right action welcome one as they travel from one life to the next."

"If, by giving up comfort, greater happiness can be found, the wise would give up comfort.

The foolish seek comfort, even if it causes suffering of others.
There is no escape from the trap of animosity.

Sinners do what should not be done, and fail to do what should be done.

It is difficult to renounce the world, and it is difficult to live a normal life. 
In these ways the wayfarer is beset with troubles.
End your suffering, cease being a wayfarer.

A person devoted to faith is honored wherever they live."

VIRTUE 

Strive against injustice and corruption with strength and courage.

If you do not believe you can say or do the right thing, at the right time - say and do nothing.

One should always try to change the world for the better - even if you fail, you will inspire others.


Nothing is a sin, unless it causes suffering and separation.

The Human Heart, like water, takes the path of least resistance.

Through words, measurements, and laws, one can discipline themselves, and direct the efforts of ten, or a hundred thousand.

Accept the Mantle of Responsibility; protect this world, and all life upon it.

What is good compared to evil, or right compared to wrong?
What is the difference between rewarding merit and punishing wickedness?

The Red Road of Life, the Black Road of Death.

One path will always lead to perpetual growth and new possibilities, one path will always lead to a spiral of decay, and the closing off of potential.

Patience over Haste;
Simplicitiy over Complexity;
Harmony over Conflict;
Sincerity over Dishonesty;
Resolve over Hesitation;
Compassion over Contempt;
Understanding over Ignorance;
Modesty over Conceit;
Solidarity over Hostility;
Community over Isolation;

Self Creation over Self Destruction.

A good home is warm and dry, a bad home cannot keep out the rain and wind;
A good well draws clear water, water from a bad well will make one sick;
A good wheel will travel many miles, a bad wheel breaks along the way;
A good dog listens, a bad dog bites;
A good farmer has many harvests, a bad farmer only few;
A good archer never misses, a bad archer never strikes true.

Those with good intent cannot be harmed; those with ill intent cannot avoid it.

A weak person is easily corrupted, and falls often into sin.
It takes no skill, discipline, strength, or training to give in to impulse.

A strong person is sincere, optimistic, faithful, kind, content, selfless, humble, observant, curious, balanced - they live in a Wakan way.

The consequences of a weak person's acts always end in conflict, suffering, and ruin.
The consequences of a strong person's acts always end in peace, alleviation of suffering, and restoration.

All that is evil and weak in the human heart grows through cruelty, neglect, and fear.
All that is good and strong in the human heart grows through kindness, love, and understanding.

Live and die in a way that benefits no one, and you will be hated, laughed at, forgotten.
Live and die in a way that benefits many, and you will be remembered and revered among the honored dead.

"Be Good, and Good for Something."

The foolish surrender themselves.

Do not lose yourself to negligence and sensuality.

This body, as fragile, transient, and insubstantial as ocean foam;
destroy the tempters's arrows, put yourself beyond death's grasp.

Just as a raging flood sweeps away a sleeping village,
So does death claim one who is distracted by life's fleeting pleasures.

Death drowns the unsatisfied man, whose restless mind seeks greater and greater pleasure.

One born to this world should do good deeds.

The scent of flowers is carried as far as the wind allows,
but good deeds go to the ends of the Earth in all directions.

One who lives well rises above the world like a lotus rises over the water."

Should a traveler fail to find a companion equal or better, one should walk alone.

'I have children, I have wealth' - these are the empty claims of a fool. If one cannot call themselves their own, how can they claim anything?

To the extent that a fool knows their foolishness, they may be deemed wise.
A fool who considers themselves wise, is indeed foolish.

A fool may associate with the wise throughout their life and remain untouched by wisdom.

A conscious person, at a moment's meeting, can learn from the wise and the foolish alike.

The fool, lacking understanding, behaves as if they were their own worst enemy, committing evil deeds and receiving bitter fruit.

It is unwise to do things that bring regret and suffering.
It is wise to do things that bring joy and fulfillment.

Until they feel the effect, the fool rejoices in their evil deed. 
When the act reaches fruition, the fool harvests nothing but grief.

Though a fool may practice ascetism, they are not worth one-sixteenth of a true seeker.

An evil deed does not produce all of its results at once.
It smolders slowly, like a fire under ashes, waiting to consume the unwise.

The things a fool gains amount to nothing.

What a fool hungers for is false fame, authority, power, and wealth. They seek recognition, their craving and pride are insatiable.

There is a path that leads to worldly gain, and another that leads to paradise.
Let the seeker, embracing seclusion, take the path to enlightenment."

"Do not lose a moment of doing good.
Protect your mind from evil.
Whoever neglects doing good, is inviting addiction to evil.

If one has mistakenly committed an evil deed,
Let them not repeat it, and become addicted.
It is the amassing of evil that brings misery.

If one does good, let them do it repeatedly,
Let them put their heart into it,
For the accumulation of good that brings blessings.

Do not underestimate evil.
As a cup slowly fills with water, drop by drop,
So does a fool slowly become full of evil.

Do not underestimate good.
Water falling, drop by drop, will fill the largest container.
One who turns from evil can eventually become goodness itself

One who has hands free of wounds may hold poison in the hands.
One who acts without evil intention is free from guilt.

There is no place in the world where a sinner can hide, safe from the consequences of their own actions.

There is no place in the world where one can escape the inevitability of death."

"Everyone fears suffering and death.
Knowing this, feel for others as you do for yourself,
And do not cause suffering or death for other beings.

If one, pursuing happiness, strikes other living beings, also striving to live happily, they will face the consequences of their actions.

If one pursues their own happiness, causing no harm to other living things, they will face the consequences of their actions.

Avoid harsh speech; angry words backfire on the speaker.

The fool, committing evil deeds, realizes it not, and suffers as if consumed by fire.
Upon destruction of the body, they will go on to another unhappy state.

Though one may do penance, walking through the forests with long and tangled hair and an ashen forehead, they cannot purify one of doubt.

Regardless of attire or adornment, the guiltless one, calm, self-restrained, chaste, and resolute, lives as a monk.

It is rare that one is self-directed, and does not invite reproof.

"One is not righteous who decides impulsively.
Whoever distinguishes between right and wrong, is righteous.

Whoever leads others, not with an even hand, not with force, is a guardian of justice, and may be called righteous.

One is not considered wise because they talk often, and say much.
They are wise who are free of hate, and do no harm.

One is not considered well versed in Dharma by their rhetoric, but by the practice of virtue.

Gray hair does not make a man wise, but experience, truth, righteousness, harmlessness, restrain, self-mastery.
Such an elder is free of stain and rich in wisdom.

Neither good looks or a silver tongue can make one attractive, if they are envious, stingy, and dishonest.

A shaven head does not make one a monk.
If he is undisciplined and dishonest, filled with desire and greed, how can they be called a monk?

Living simply does not make one holy if they behave badly.

They who live for a higher life, full of understanding, free of good and evil, can be called holy.

One cannot be called wise because they are silent.
Only they who are aware, conscious, deciding wisely, they may be called a sage.

Having discerned both worlds, the inner and outer lives, having chosen good over evil, they may be called a sage.

If one harms living beings, how can they be considered noble?

Only by living for the benefit of all beings can one be considered noble.

Not merely performing rituals and observances do I weave ascetic bliss; one should not rest content until all the waves of the mind have been stilled."

"The liar is one headed for sorrow.
One who denies what they have done is headed for sorrow.
Both will go the same way after death.

Many are mean and undisciplined; living that way, they are headed for sorrow.

Slight is the pleasure of a frightened person, who knows severe consequences are sure to follow.

Just as a blade handled improperly cuts the hand, so can life lead one to a sorrowful state.

Some see what is right as wrong, and what is wrong as right.
Believing in delusions, they go on to a sorrowful state.

Those who see wrong as wrong, and right as right, live in clarity, and go on to a joyful state."


He who is brave in daring will be killed;
He who is brave in not daring will survive.
Of these two kinds, one is beneficial, while the other proves harmful.
Some things are detested by Heaven, but who knows the reason?
Even the Sage is baffled by such a question.

if you have pride in your renunciation and asceticism, you are doing them in vain

hunger and sexual arousal serve natural purposes, to prolong life and continue the species.
greed and lust are not natural

denial does not help. what does?

bad company is loss, good company is gain;
joining with wind, dust flies into the clouds;
joining with water, it turns to mud and sinks.

it's easy to be caught up in self-gratification

you can't just make believe you're pure; many are called, but few are chosen


/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/	/


"If someone finds a wise person, who can skillfully point out shortcomings and give suitable proof, cherish that person as a revealer of treasure. Only good can come from knowing them.

Let the wise guide, correct, and deter others from what is base and vile, he will be treasured by the good, and spurned by evil.

Do not choose bad friends. Do not choose people of low habits.
Select good friends. Be discriminating. Choose what is best.

"What is in the end to be shrunken, begins by being stretched out.
What is in the end to be weakened, begins by first being made strong.
What is in the end to be thrown down, begins by being first set on high.
What is in the end to be despoiled, begins by being first richly endowed.

Herein is the subtle wisdom of life:
The soft and weak overcomes the hard and strong.

Just as the fish must not leave the depths, so must one not display their ability."

"The greatest perfection seems imperfect, and yet its use is inexhaustible;
The greatest fullness seems empty, yet its use is endless.

The greatest straightness appears crooked, the greatest skill appears clumsy, the greatest eloquence sounds like a nonsense.


Block all passages, shut all doors, and to the end of your days you will not be tired.

Open the passages, multiply your activities, and to the end of your days, you will remain helpless.

To see the small is to have insight, to hold onto weakness is to be strong; use lights, but return to your insight.
Do not bring calamaty upon yourself.
This is the way of cultivating the Changeless."


"there is action in inaction, inaction in action"


"stop talking, stop thinking, and there will be nothing you do not understand."


"Patience is the most beautiful virtue, and the least understood"

"A single wise word that brings peace, is worth more than a thousand speeches of empty words.

A verse full of meaning that brings peace to the listener is worth more than a thousand songs of empty words.

One may recite an entire book or sutra, but a single hymn that brings peace is worth far more.

Making offerings for glory and recognition, is worth nothing compared to honoring the righteous.

Whoever shows reverence and respect for elders is rewarded fourfold.

Even a single day lived virtuously, is worth more than a lifetime of worldly achievement.

A single day of reflective contemplation is worth more than a lifetime of idleness and ignorance.

The wise one, carefully, moment by moment, one by one, eliminates the stains on their mind.

Just as rust corrodes iron, so is a sinner destroyed by their own wrong actions.

One who gives with a grudge loses their generosity.
Deeds done with ill intent are forever stained.

Eliminate ignorance, and purity follows.

Life is easy for one who is shameless, aggressive, arrogant, intrusive, corrupt.

Life is not easy for one who is modest, with high values, free from attachment, humble, of right livelihood, with clear vision.

Whoever in this world takes life, lies, steals, commits adultery, is addicted to drinking poison, is digging up their own roots.

Be aware, that those flawed in their nature have no control of themselves. Do not let greed and anger cause you suffering.

People give for many reasons, such as devotion or appreciation.
Whoever finds fault, will have no peace.

Whoever gives up their habit of finding fault, will know peace.

Cut off self-delusion, doubt, attachment to beliefs, sensuality, and desires;
Cut off pride, restlesslessness, ignorance, and desire for power;
Cultivate confidence, mindfulness, effort, concentration, and insight;
Trascend passion, anger, ignorance, pride, and delusion.

One who is composed, who cannot be tempted, can be called peaceful.

Therefore, the Sage manages their affairs without ado, and spreads their teaching without talking. They deny nothing, lay claim to nothing, do work without taking pride, accomplishes tasks without dwelling upon them.

And yet, it is just becaue they do not dwell upon it, that no one can take it away from them."

"Heaven and Earth are not sentimental, treating all things the same.
The sage is not sentimental, treating all things the same.

"Only simple and quiet words will ripen of themselves.
A whirlwind does not last a whole morning, nor does a shower last a whole day. Who is their author? Heaven and Earth!
Even Heaven and Earth cannot make such violent things last long; how much more true is it of the rash endeavours of humanity?

Cultivate Virtue, and it becomes a genuine part of you.
Cultivate it in the family, and it will abide.
Cultivate it in the community, and it will live and grow.
Cultivate it in the state, and it will flourish abundantly.
Cultivate it in the world, and it will become universal.

Hence, a person must be judged as a person, a family as a family, a community as a community, a state as a state, the world as the world

How do I know about the world? By what is within me."

"The softest of all things overrides the hardest of all things.
Only Nothing can enter into no space, hence I know the advantages of wu wei.

Few things under heaven are as instructive as the lessons of Silence, or as beneficial as the fruits of wu wei."

It is Heaven's Way to conquer without striving, to get responses without speaking, to induce the people to come without summoning, to act according to plans without haste.

"One on tiptoes cannot stand long, one astride something cannot walk. One who displays themselves does not shine, one who justifies themselves has no glory.
One who boasts of their own ability has no merit, one who parades their own success will not endure long.

In Tao these things are called 'unwanted food and extraneous growths', which are loathed by all things - and one of the Tao does not set their heart upon them."

"One who knows how to guide a ruler in the path of Tao does not try to override the world with force of arms and written laws.

It is in the nature of a weapon to turn against its wielder.

Wherever armies are stationed, thorny bushes grow.
After a great war, bad years invariably follow.

What you want is to protect your own state, but not to aim at self-aggrandizement.

After you have attained your purpose, you must not parade your success, boast of your ability, or feel proud.

You must regret that you had not been able to prevent war; 
You must never think of conquering others by force.

To be overdeveloped is to hasten decay, and this is against Tao, and what is against Tao will soon cease to be."

"Fine weapons of war augur evil; 
Even things seem to hate them.
One of the Tao does not set their heart upon them.

In ordinary life, one regards the left side as a place of honor;
In war, the right side.

As weapons are instruments of evil purpose, they are not a Sage's instruments; only on necessity should one resort to them.
For peace and quiet are dearest to their heart, and to them, even a victory is no cause for celebration.

To rejoice over victory is to celebrate the slaughter of one's own family; one who dances and sings of the murder of men cannot expect to live in the world of men.

On happy occasions the left side is preferred; 
On sad occasions, the right side.

In the army, the lieutenant stands on the left, while the commander stands on the right.
War is a funeral service.

Many have been killed, and it is only right that survivors mourn for them - even victory is a funeral."


Truly, too much honor means no honor;
It is not wise to shine like jade and sound like stone."

"Without going out of your door, you can know the ways of the world. 

Without seeing through your window, you can see the Way of Heaven.

The farther you go, the less you know.

Thus, the Sage knows without traveling, sees without looking, and achieves without doing anything."

"Learning consists of daily accumulation, the practice of the Tao consists in daily diminishing.

Keep on diminishing, until you reach the state of wu wei.
Do nothing, and yet nothing is left undone.

"All the world says that my Tao is great, but seems queer, like nothing on Earth; but because it great, that it like nothing on Earth!

If it were like anything at all, how small it would have been from the very beginning!

I have Three Treasures, which I hold fast, and watch closely.
Mercy, Frugality, and Not Daring to Be First.

Because I am merciful, I can be brave;
Because I am frugal, I can be generous;
Because I dare not be first, therefore I can be a grand vessel.

If one wishes to be brave without mercy, generous without frugality, or to become a leader without first following, they are courting death.

Mercy alone will help you win wars and defend your state; Heaven comes to the rescue of the merciful, to protect them with Mercy."
This is called the Virtue of Non-Striving, this is called using the abilities of mankind, this is called being wedded to Heaven."

"The strategists have a saying:
I dare not be a host, but rather a guest;
I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.

This is called marching without moving, rolling up sleeves without baring arms, capturing the enemy without confrontation, holding an invisible weapon.

There is no greater calamity than to underestimate the strength of an enemy; therefore, when opposing troops meet in battle, victory belongs to the grieving side."










'being upright, you will be still;
being still, you will be enlightened;
being enlightened, you will be empty;
being empty, you will do nothing, and yet there will be nothing that is not done..'

Power moves, but is not moved.

Cunning is not intelligence, cynicism is not wisdom.

Ignorance and conceit are twins.

"You will give an account for every word spoken; in speaking, thy words are given power"

Shining truth and loving kindness live on.

Those who do not find their way to a higher life, or who fail to earn fame and fortune in their youth, look back with regret in old age, like arrows that have missed their mark."

"Do not live carelessly. Do not prolong the suffering of the world.
Lift yourself up. Be attentive and virtuous.
Those who do good deeds and follow this path live happily, in this life, and those that come after.

Restrain your speech, control your mind, commit no evil deeds.
By these means, begin to walk the path laid out by the sages.

Wisdom is born from meditation.
Make the choice to walk where wisdom grows.

"The highest form of goodness is like water;
Water knows how to benefit everything without striving, and stays in places loathed by all.

Therefore, it comes close to the Tao.

In choosing your dwelling, know how to keep to the ground;
In cultivating the mind, know how to dive to the hidden depths;
In dealing with others, know how to be gentle and kind;
In speaking, know how to choose your words;
In governing, know how to maintain order;
In transacting business, know how to be efficient;
In making a move, know how to choose the right moment.

If one does not strive, they will be free from blame."

"In keeping the spirit and the soul together, are you able to maintain their perfect harmony?

In gathering your vital energy to attain power, have you reached the state of a newborn babe?

In washing and clearing your inner vision, have you purified it of all stain?

In loving your people and governing your affairs, are you able to dispense with cunning and cleverness?

In the opening and shutting of Heaven's Gate, are you able to play the Feminine part?

Enlightened and seeing into all directions, can you at the same time remain detached and nonactive?

Rear your people, feed your people, and never claim them as your own! Do your work without claiming it! Be a leader, not a butcher!

This is called Hidden Virtue."


"Know the masculine, keep to the Feminine;
Be the river of the world.

To be the river of the world is to move constantly in the path of Virtue without turning, and to return again to the source.

Know the white, keep to the black, and be part of the pattern of the world.

To be part of the pattern of the world is to move constantly in the path of Virtue, without erring a single step, and to return again to the Infinite.

Know the glorious, keep to the lowly, and be the fountain of the world.
To be the fountain of the world is to live the abundant life of Virtue, and return again to Primal Simplicity.

When Primal Simplicity diversifies, it becomes useful, and in the hands of a Sage, can do great things.

Hence, 'a great tailor does little cutting'."

"High Virtue is nonvirtuous; therefore it has Virtue.
Low virtue never frees itself from virtuousness; therefore it has no Virtue.

High Virtue makes no fuss and has no private ends to serve;
Low Virtue not only fusses but has private ends.

High ceremony fusses but finds no response; then tries to enforce itself with rolled-up sleeves.

Failing Tao, we resort to Virtue;
Failing virtue, we resort to Humanity;
Failing humanity, we resort to Morality;
Failing morality, we resort to Ceremony.

Ceremony is the husk of faith and loyalty;
It is the beginning of all confusion and disorder.

Therefore, a Sage sets the heart upon the substance rather than the husk, upon the fruit, rather than the flower; truly, they prefer what is within to what is without."

"When a wise person hears of the Tao, they practice it diligently.
When a scholar hears of the Tao, they waver between belief and disbelief.
When a fool hears of it, they laugh - but if fools did not laugh at it, the Tao would not be the Tao!

The bright Way looks dim;
The progressive Way looks backwards;
The smooth Way looks rough.

High Virtue looks like an abyss;
Great purity looks stained.

Abundant Virtue seems deficient;
Established Virtue seems decrepit;
Solid Virtue seems shapeless.

Great Squares have no corners;
Great talents ripen late;
Great Sound is silent;
The Great Form is Formless.

The Tao is hidden and nameless, yet it knows how to render help and fulfill all things."


What is more loathed by people than to be helpless and worthless?

Truly, one may gain by losing; and one may lose by gaining.

What another has taught, let me repeat -
One who lives in violence meets a violent end.
Whoever said this can be my teacher."

"When the world is in possession of the Tao, the horses walk and graze on green fields.

When the world loses the Tao, war horses feed in the suburbs.

There is no calamity like not knowing what is enough;
There is no evil like greed.

Only they who know what is enough, will ever have enough."

"When one is out of Life, they go into Death.

It is said that they who know how to live well meet no tigers, snakes, or scorpions on the path, and come out from battle untouched.

In them, there is nothing for a tiger to lay their claws upon, a snake to sink fangs into, no place for a spear to place its point.

There is no room for Death in a Sage."

The court is clean, but the fields are dry and granaries empty;
They wear gorgeous clothes and carry sharp swords, surfeited with food and drink, and more wealth than they can use in a lifetime - they are bandits, brigands.

As for the Tao - what do they know about it?"

"One steeped in Virtue is akin to a newborn babe;
Nothing bad happens to it, it is soft, but has a firm grip;
It can cry for hours, because it embodies perfect harmony.

The fewer people know one, they closer they are;
Therefore, a Sage wears coarse clothes, and keeps jade jewelry hidden."

"When the people are no longer afraid of death, why attempt to scare them?

If one makes the people always afraid of Death, and they still persist in breaking laws, then why attempt to arrest and execute them?

Is not the Great Executioner always killing?

To do the killing for Death is to chop wood for a master carpenter, and you would be lucky indeed if you did not hurt yourself."

"Why are people starving? Because those above them tax them too heavily.

Why are people difficult? Because those above them serve private ends.

Why do people make light of Death? Because those above them make too much of life.

The people have nothing to live for, and know better than to value such a life."

A good word will find its own place, a good deed can be given as a gift.

One who strays from the path need not be cast away.

At the enthronement of a sovereign, at the installation of ministers, let others offer jade and horses - it is better for you to offer the Tao without leaving your home!

Why did the ancients prize the Tao?
Is it not because by virtue of it one who seeks finds, and the guilty are forgiven?"

Act without acting, speak without speaking, hear without being heard, see without being seen, know without being known.

One who keeps the Tao does not want to be full, but precisely because they are never full, they can remain like a hidden seed, waiting patiently to grow."

They do not make a show themselves, and hence they shine;
They do not justify themselves, and hence become known;
They do not boast of their ability, and hence they gain merit;
They do not brandish success, and hence they endure;
They compete with no one, and hence no one competes with them.


In the midst of the world, the Sage is shy, and self-effacing; for the sake of the world, they keep their heart in silent peace.

All the people strain their senses, and the Sage smiles like an amused child."

Difficult things of the world can only be tackled when they are easy;
Big things in the world can only come from small beginnings.

The Sage never has to tackle difficult things, yet they alone are capable of doing so.

One who promises lightly must be lacking in faith;
One who thinks all will be easy will find everything difficult.

A Sage regards everything as difficult, and meets with no difficulties."

"What is at rest is easy to hold, what manifests no omens is easily forestalled.

What is fragile is easily shattered, what is small is easily scattered.

Tackle things before they appear; cultivate peace and order before confusion has set in.

One who fusses over anything spoils it;
One who grasps anything loses it.

A Sage fusses over and grasps at nothing, therefore spoils and loses nothing.

In handling affairs, people often spoil them at the point of success."

"Let go of your anger and pride, break every chain.

Whoever controls his anger is in command of themselves, instead of just being along for the ride.

Where there is anger, offer kindness,
Where there is evil, offer good,
Where there is greed, offer generosity,
Where there are lies, offer truth.

The wise do no harm, come to a place of peace, and sorrow no more.

They criticize the silent, the talkative, the moderate.
There is no one in this world who escapes criticism.

There never was and never will be, nor is there now,
One who is entirely hated, or entirely loved.

Practice restraint and self control."

when your center is firm, it matters not what company you keep; all beings are on the path to enlightenment in their own ways, the differ only to the degree that the veil clouds their vision





truth gets you high. lies bring you down

think of the lies you have told - what would change if the truth were known?

illusions are mistresses, truth is marriage

'open up your hand, child, and don't be so prideful...ain't nothing but stuff you got hiding in there'

"By not exalting the talented, you will cause the people to cease from rivalry and contention;
By not prizing goods hard to get, you will cause the people to cease from robbing and stealing;
By not displaying what is desireable, you will cause the people's hearts to remain undisturbed.

Therefore, a sage governs by emptying the heart of desires, filling the belly with food, weakening ambitions, and toughening bones.

In this way, they will cause the people to remain without knowledge and without desire, and prevent the knowing from any ado. Practice Non-Ado (Wu Wei), and everything will be in order."

"As for pouring to fullness, far better is it to stop in time!

Keep on sharpening a blade, and the edge cannot be preserved long.

Fill your house with gold and jade, and it can no longer be guarded; set store by your riches and honor, and you will only find calamity.

Here is the Way of Heaven -
When you have done your work, retire!"

"The five colors blind the eye, the five tones deafen the ear, the five flavors numb the palate.

Racing and hunting madden the mind; rare goods tempt one to do wrong.

Therefore, the Sage takes care of the belly, instead of the eyes.
They prefer what is within to what is without."

"The highest type of ruler is one of whose existence the people are barely aware. Next comes one whom they love and praise; then one whom they fear; then one whom they despise and defy.

The Sage is self-effacing and scanty of words; when their task is accomplished and things have been completed, all the people say, 'we have done it!'"

Truly, humility is the root from which greatness springs, and the high must be built upon the foundation of the low;
This is why Sages realize their dependence on the lowly.


"When one is alive, they are soft and supple;
When they are dead, they become hard and rigid.

When a plant is alive, it is soft and tender;
When it is dead, it becomes withered and dry.

Hence, the hard and rigid belongs to the dead, and the soft and supple belongs to the living.

Therefore, a mighty army tends to fall by its own weight, like dry wood ready for the axe.

The mighty and great are laid low, and the humble and weak are exalted."

"Nothing in the world is softer and weaker than water;
But for attacking the hard and strong, there is nothing like it.

Nothing can take its place - the weak overcomes the strong, and the soft overcomes the hard; this is something known by all, but practiced by none.

Therefore, the Sage says: "To recieve the dirt of a country is to be the lord of its shrines; to bear the calamaties of a country is to be the prince of the world."

Indeed, Truth sounds like its opposite!"

"A great country is like the lowland toward which all streams flow; it is the reservoir of all under heaven, the Feminine of the world.

The Feminine always conquers the Masculine through silence and grace.

If a great country can humble itself before a small one, it will win it over; if a small country is humble before a larger one, it will win it over.

What a great country wants is to embrace more people; what a small country wants is to serve its patrons."

"How does the sea become the king of all streams? 
Because it lays lower than they!
Hence it is the emperor of streams.

Therefore, a Sage reigns over people by being humble; leads them by putting themselves behind them.

When a Sage stands above the people, they do not feel heaviness, but lightness; when they stand in front of the people, they do not feel hurt.

Therefore all the world is glad to push them forward, without becoming tired of them.

Because a Sage strives with no one, no one strives with them."


"A good soldier is never aggressive or angry; the best way to conquer an enemy is to win them over with friendship.

The best way to employ a person is to serve under them.


"Heaven lasts long, and Earth abides.
What is the secret of their durability?
Is it not because they do not live for themselves that they can live so long?

Therefore, the Sage wants to remain behind, but finds themself ahead of others; reckons themselves out, but finds themselves safe and secure.

Is it not because they are selfless that their Self is realized?"

"Bend and you will be whole, turn, and you will go forward;
Keep empty and you will be full, grow old and you will be renewed.

Have little and you will gain; have much, and you will be confused.

"Heaviness is the root of lightness; serenity is the master of restlessness.

A sage, traveling all day, does not part from the caravan;
Though there may be gorgeous sights along the way, they remain at ease.

Why would the lord of ten thousand chariots display lightness to the world?

To be light is to be separated from one's root; to be restless is to lose one's self mastery."

"The ancient adepts of the Tao were subtle and flexible, profound and comprehensive.

Their minds were too deep to be fathomed.

Because they were unfathomable, one can only describe them by their appearances.

The ancient ones were hesitant like wading through a stream in winter;
Timid like one afraid of their neighbors;
Cautious and corteous like a guest;
Yielding like melting ice;
Simple like uncarved stone;
Hollow like a deep cave;
As unclear as a muddy water.

And yet, who else could quietly and gradually evolve from muddy water to clear; who else could slowly but steadily move from the inert to living?

We are each one of us responsible for every war because of the aggressiveness of our own lives, because of our nationalism, our selfishness, our gods, our prejudices, our ideals, all of which divide us.

- Jiddu Krishnamurti


This life is short, the vanities of the world are transient, but they alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead than alive.

Let me tell you again that you must be pure and help any one who comes to you, as much as lies in your power. And this is good Karma. By the power of this, the heart becomes pure (Chitta-shuddhi), and then Shiva who is residing in every one will become manifest. He is always in the heart of every one. If there is dirt and dust on a mirror, we cannot see our image. So ignorance and wickedness are the dirt and dust that are on the mirror of our hearts. Selfishness is the chief sin, thinking of ourselves first. He who thinks, "I will eat first, I will have more money than others, and I will possess everything", he who thinks, "I will get to heaven before others I will get Mukti before others" is the selfish man. The unselfish man says, "I will be last, I do not care to go to heaven, I will even go to hell if by doing so I can help my brothers." This unselfishness is the test of religion. He who has more of this unselfishness is more spiritual and nearer to Shiva. Whether he is learned or ignorant, he is nearer to Shiva than anybody else, whether he knows it or not. And if a man is selfish, even though he has visited all the temples, seen all the places of pilgrimage, and painted himself like a leopard, he is still further off from Shiva.


It is the coward and the fool who says, This is my fate – so says the Sanskrit proverb. But it is the strong man who stands up and says, I will make my own fate. It is people who are getting old who talk of fate.

People have become so degraded in this Kali Yuga that they think they can do anything, and then they can go to a holy place, and their sins will be forgiven. If a man goes with an impure mind into a temple, he adds to the sins that he had already, and goes home a worse man than when he left it.

Shiva is that master, and this world is His garden, and there are two sorts of gardeners here; the one who is lazy, hypocritical, and does nothing, only talking about Shiva's beautiful eyes and nose and other features; and the other, who is taking care of Shiva's children, all those that are poor and weak, all animals, and all His creation
- Swami Vivekenanda

The Master said, "Anciently, the intelligent kings served their fathers with filial piety, and therefore they served Heaven with intelligence. They served their mothers with filial piety, and therefore they served Earth with discrimination. They pursued the right course with reference to their (own) seniors and juniors, and therefore they secured the regulation of the relations between superiors and inferiors (throughout the kingdom). When Heaven and Earth were served with intelligence and discrimination, the spiritual intelligences displayed (their retributive power)." (16)[18]

Therefore, by virtue of resting empty and reposed, he waits for the course of nature to enforce itself so that all names will be defined of themselves, and all affairs will be settled of themselves. 

Empty, he knows the essence of fullness: reposed, he becomes the corrector of motion. 

Who utters a word creates himself a name; who has an affair creates himself a form. 

"Skilful deception is not as good as unskilful sincerity.

But how do we know Heaven desires righteousness and abominates unrighteousness? 

For, with righteousness the world lives and without it the world dies; with it the world becomes rich and without it the world becomes poor; with it the world becomes orderly and without it the world becomes chaotic. 

Heaven likes to have the world live and dislikes to have it die, likes to have it rich and dislikes to have it poor, and likes to have it orderly and dislikes to have it disorderly. 

Therefore we know Heaven desires righteousness and abominates unrighteousness.

Heaven abominates the large state which attacks small states, the large house which molests small houses, the strong who plunder the weak, the clever who deceive the stupid, and the honoured who disdain the humble - these are what the will of Heaven abominates. 

On the other hand, it desires people having energy to work for each other, those knowing the way to teach each other, and those possessing wealth to share with each other

There are those who love the people and benefit the people,
and obey the will of Heaven and obtain reward from Heaven. 

There are also those who hate the people and oppress the people,
and oppose the will of Heaven and incur punishment from Heaven.
- Mozi

Just because you win the fight
Don't make you right
Just because you give
Don't make you good


Why boasteth thyself
Oh, evil men
Playing smart
And not being clever?
I said, you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity (if a-so a-so)
But the goodness of Jah, Jah
I-dureth forever
So if you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
To cut you down
These are the words
Of my master, keep on tellin' me
No weak heart
Shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it
Shall fall in it (fall in it)


Until the philosophy which hold one race
Superior and another Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Everywhere is war

That until there are no longer
First-class and second-class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes

That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race

That until that day
The dream of lasting peace
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained

And until the ignoble and unhappy regime
That hold our brothers in Angola
In Mozambique
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled
Utterly destroyed
Well, everywhere is war

And until that day
The African continent
Will not know peace
We Africans will fight, we find it necessary
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil


Guiltiness (talkin' 'bout guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience. Oh yeah.
And they live their lives (they live their lives)
On false pretence everyday -
Each and everyday. Yeah.
These are the big fish
Who always try to eat down the small fish,
Just the small fish.
I tell you what: they would do anything
To materialize their every wish. Oh yeah-eah-eah-eah.

Say: Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sorrow!
Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!


How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
That you care?
When every time I look around,
The people suffer in the suffering
In every way, in everywhere

I tell you what some people got everything
Some people got nothing
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means

So I Idren, I sistren,
The preaching and talkin' is done
We've gotta live up, wo now, wo now!
'Cause the Father's time has come
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't wait for long


Fret not thyself of evildoers
Neither be thou envious (of iniquity workers)
Some put their trust in horses and chariots (so ridicoulous)
Things of fine silk, linen and gold
What profit a man, save his own life
And lose his own soul?
Don't you know the world around you
It will crumble and fall
But the earth is Jah Lord and the fulness thereof
For I and I to dwell therein

All that you put into the world will return to you tenfold - be kind, and careful of how you treat yourself, others, and nature.


















"Mindfulness is the path to immortality,
Negligence is the path to death.
The vigilant never die, while the negligent are dead already.

With this understanding, those who are wise rejoice in mindfulness.

The awakened ones, dedicated to meditation, attain Nirvana.

The wise one, by self-mastery, creates an island no flood can submerge.



Free of sorrow, one gazes at the masses as one on a mountain looks upon the valleys and plains below.

The mindful person among the mindless,
the aware among the unaware,
surpasses the rest without being noticed.

A seeker, concentrating on mindfulness, advances like fire, consuming the chains of their own bondage."

"Who can truly see this world, and the realm of the gods?
Who is able to distill the wisdom of the Dharma as one who designs garlands of flowers?

A Sekha, one upon the first stages of perfection, can percieve that there are many realms; even they can bring forth the shining truth of the Dharma.




One should dwell and act in the village, as a bee taking pollen from a flower, and leaving the color and fragrance intact.

Pay no attention to what is said or done by others, pay close attention to your own actions and inactions.




"Long is the night to the sleepless,
Long is the road to the weary traveler.
Long is the cycle of rebirths to the unwise, who do not know the truth.


























By making yourself as still as stone, you achieve Nirvana.

As a shepherd herds sheep, so do desires, suffering, and death drive all living beings.





Have an abundance of confidence. Be aware and attentive.
Put aside this great mass of suffering.

Farmers irrigate the land.
Carpenters shape wood.
Virtuous people improve themselves."





















"Unchecked desire strangles a careless person, like vines growing around a tree. They will leap from lifetime to lifetime, like a monkey seeking fruit.

This craving, this clinging, overpowers one caught in it, and their sorrows multiply, like grass fed by the rains.

Although it is difficult to find freedom, sorrow leaves one who overcomes desire and attachment to this world, as drops of water fall from a leaf.

Pull out desire from the root like a weed. 
Do not succumb to temptation over and over again.

A tree may be cut down, but the roots remain, and it springs up again. Likewise, suffering will return, if the desire is not eradicated.

One will be swept along by thirt-six streams of sensual pleasure, borne on currents toward temptation.

Pleasurable sensations arise, and these feelings are heightened by desire; most beings cling to these sensations, not willing to let go, and they are compelled to experience suffering, over and over again.

Rushing about like trapped rabbits, caught in their desires, they suffer over and over again.

There are bonds of iron, wood, and grass.
Far stronger are the bonds of possessions and loved ones.

Wise ones recognize attachments, and let them untie themselves, freeing themslves from bondage.

Let go of the past, let go of the future, let go of the present.
Proceed to the other shore with a free mind.

Having myself realized all, whom shall I call my teacher?

The gift of truth is the highest gift,
The taste of truth is the sweetest taste,
The joy of truth is the greatest joy,
The extinction of desire is the end of suffering.

Weeds choke the fields.
Desire corrupts humankind.

The gifts given to those free of desire bring the greatest rewards."




"Tao never makes any adoa, and yet it does everything.

If a ruler can cling to it, all things will grow of themselves. 
When they have grown and tend to make a stir, it is time to keep them in their place by the aid of the nameless Primal Simplicity,
Which alone can curb the desires of men.
When the desires of men are curbed, there will be peace, and the world will settle down of its own accord."





Vast is Heaven's net;
Sparse-meshed it is, and yet nothing can slip through it."





















"As for your name and your body, which is more dear?
As for your body and your wealth, which is more prized?
As for gain and loss, which is more painful?

An excessive love for anything will cost you dearly in the end; accumulation only leads to heavy loss.

To know when you have enough is to be free of disgrace, to know when to stop is to be saved from peril. 

Only thus can you endure long."

the life of achievement is empty, without fulfillment.

success is not enough

"it was all not honest enough"

"not enough was happening that was real or meaningful"

if you have any desire besides that of liberation, at each stage you will become more and more capable of gratifying that desire..
by thinking of a desire, over and over, you increase attachment, its hold over you, and slow your journey.

the gratification of desire is temporary, and replaced by new desires, a spiral of intent and action, creating karma, consequences.

desiring to 'do good' or 'tell others' too strongly will blind one to what is truly best for all beings and situations; one may only increase the confusion of humanity, instead of revealing illusions.

as long as the mind is caught up in the world, and you are caught up in your mind, you remain within an illusion..

thought is impersonal, temporary, and capable of causing great suffering.

the work is turning these negative identifications and desires, personalities and dreams, stories and dramas, into something static instead of dynamic and changing, and then letting them fall away.

duality is the means; non duality is the end

the desire to teach others and help them, is a reflection of a lack of wisdom - 'only some can see and hear'
only certain people awaken in each lifetime; you can only reach someone as far as they have reached themselves, and as far as you have went within yourself - and there is no destination

you are not your desires; there will always be desire; desire is part of the dance of nature

you do not need to give up the world, only your attachment to it

'desire is a trap,
desire is the world,
desire the creator,
desire is the destroyer' - hari dass baba

everywhere I look, I see only my own desires - hari dass baba

quit this world, quit the next world, quit quitting

the drop out is internal, not external; drop out of attachments, obsessions, illusions, separations

give up all desires

no attachment, no clinging, no desire, no suffering

if I get free of my ego, we all get free; I DO SADHANA; I can do nothing for you but work on myself

help others through their illusions once you are free of your own; give people internal treasures, not external ones..

if you think you're doing anything, you have much work to do..
as long as we desire new and more experiences, we will never go beyond samsara


/	/	/	/	/	/	/


Whoever drinks deeply of Dharma lives happily, with a peaceful mind."

There is no fire like lust, no evil like hatred;
There are no disasters equal to the attachments to Samsara;
There is no happiness greater than the peace of Nirvana.

Hunger is the worst disease,
Conditioned things are the worst calamity.
When we see this clearly, we attain nirvana, ultimate bliss.

Health is the greatest prize.
Contentment is the greatest wealth.
A loyal friend is the best relative.
Nirvana is the supreme bliss.

Having tasted of solitude and tranquility,
One becomes free of sorrow and sin,
Savoring the nectar, the joy of spiritual excellence.

It is good to see the holy ones, 
To live with them is eternal happiness;
Not to see impious people is also eternal happiness.

Therefore - like the Moon following its ordained course,
Let each one follow a good person, who is wise and holy."

"if you are to pass into the Inner Temple, leave no enemies behind you"

only by living in the here and now, in the heart, can one become a being of light

finding fulfillment and contentment within is the key to power

the opposite of craving is contentment

cling to nothing

as you become less attached, the more interesting and humorous life becomes

A single day lived by one who grasps the ephemeral nature of all things is worth more than a lifetime spent chasing blindly after material fortune and fame.

A single day lived by one who sees the truth is worth more than a lifetime lived not seeing it."

"You are now like a withering leaf, death coming closer.
Although at the point of departure, you have not prepared yourself.

You have reached the end, you stand face to face with death,
You have no place to rest upon the road.

Prepare a refuge, work hard, use good judgement.
Free of flaws and passions, you shall enter the highest realms.
You need never return to the cycles of birth and death.


There is no fire like lust, no vice like hatred, no trap like delusion, no river like desire.

There is no path through the air,
There is no monk outside the path.
There is no refuge outside the Dharma.
There are no permanent things.

One who is gluttonous is reborn a simpleton, again and again, continuously suffering.

If one cannot find a companion that is wise and upright, walk alone, like a king leaving a conquered land, or an elephant wandering the forest.

It is better to live alone, than to have a fool for a companion.
Live alone, avoid evil, be harmless and at ease, like an elephant in the forest.

It is pleasant to have friends when you need them, to be satisfied with whatever comes your way, to know virtue at the moment of death, to be beyond all suffering.

It is pleasant to be a loving child, to show respect others, to reach old age, to be of unshakeable faith, to achieve insight, and abstain from evil."

"It is good to restrain the senses, the body, and the mind.
One with restrain and moderation is free from suffering.
One who delights in insight, development, and calm, who lives alone and is content, they may be called "Bhikkhu".

How pleasant is the discourse of the monk, spare in words, who talks with wisdom, who is simple and clear in expressing the Dharma.

One should not despise their own blessings, nor covet what others have.

One who is not attached their mind or body, who does not mourn loss and decay, they may be called "Bhikku".

One who lives in loving kindness, devoted to the teachings, will realize Nirvana. 

Empty this boat, and it will move lightly.
Cut off desire and ill-will, and you will reach Nirvana.

Just as a flower is shed when the time comes,
you must shed desire and hatred.

Hence, they who cultivate the Tao are one with the Tao;
They who practice Virtue are one with Virtue;
They who court after Loss is one with Loss.

They who know when they have enough is rich;
They who adhere assiduously to the path of Tao are people of steady purpose.
They who stay where they have found their true home endure long, they who die but perish not enjoy true longevity."


'one who gives in to their own desires has no inner friction, no inner fire'

you cannot do away with, suppress, give up, or get rid of desire.
with time and wisdom, it fades by itself


with each level of surrender and purification, giving up power, control, and gratification, you achieve new powers;
when you have given up even these, you gain all powers

as long as there are ups and downs, ins and outs, you're not quite there..











western man cannot have enough because he's not in the here and now; he lacks a center

a centered being makes you feel calm; you can't fake or pretend being calm and centered;
live from the heart!

let your innocence return, let your worldliness fall away, let the ego thin like clouds

you can't go through the door with your ego on; you have to die to be born again; avoid the messianic complex

being into your suffering is a trap; this trip requires total suffering, but you can't be the One suffering

"Forget wisdom, abandon cleverness, and the people will be benefited a hundredfold.

Forget humanity, abandon justice, and the people will return to their natural inclinations.

Forget cunning, abandon sharpness, and robbers and thieves will cease to be.

These three are the crossroads of the Tao, and are not sufficient of themselves.
Therefore, they should be subordinated to a higher principle;
See the simple and embrace the primal, diminish the self and curb desires!"





"Welcome disgrace as a pleasant surprise; prize calamities like your own body.

Why should we?

A lowly state is a boon:
Acquiring it is often a surprise, and so is losing it!

Our body is the very source of our calamity, if we have no body, what can happen to us?

forming new institutions and organizations is just perpetuating a cycle; transcend every method

Every form, method, and teaching eventually reaches an end - transcend and go beyond them.


There are those who are aware they are always facing death;
knowing this, they put aside all grudges and doubts.

One who lives for sensation and indulgence, temptation breaks, as strong winds break a frail tree.

One who lives mindfully, in self-control, moderate, devout, and energetic, cannot be tempted, just as wind cannot move a mountain.

Letting go of passion, aggression, and confusion, revering truth with a clear mind, not holding on to anything, brings the harvest of a holy life."

Look at the body, a mass of wounds upon a heap of bones, neither permanent nor enduring.

Look at the body as a boat that the ignorant cling to, even when they reach the other shore.

Better than dominion over this world, all worlds, over the heavens, is control of self, and the fruition of the path.

"The path is the best of ways, the best of truths.
Freedom from desire is the best of states.
Whoever lives with a clear mind and an open heart is counted among sages.

There is the one and only Way, there is no other path.

Following this path, you put an end to yours and others' suffering.
Having realized the way, I have shown it to you.

You yourselves must walk the path; we can only show the way.

All things are subject to change, are unsatisfactory, insubstantial.
When one realizes these truths, this is the way to purification.

The lazy one, weak in discipline, apathetic, unproductive, never finds the path.

Cut down the entire jungle of desire.
Not an isolated tree, not a few clearings.

Cut off the love of ego with your own hands, as you would a flower.

"I shall live here in the summer, and here in the winter" muses the fool, unaware of the presence of Death.

Death carries a fool away while they are still busily acquiring wealth and children, like a rampaging flood engulfing a sleeping village.

When death comes, no one can offer refuge or escape.
Aware of this, behave well, and do not postpone what is right.
Clear the path to Nirvana."

Of what avail is the matted hair, and animal hides?
Within you is a forest of defilements; you deal only with the outside.

Whoever has no desire, for either this or another world, who is detached, and unbound, having liberated themselves from doubt through awareness, who has embraced the infinite, who has gone beyond the desire to do good or evil, free of sorrow, immaculate and pure, all longing for existence extinguished, they do I call a Noble One.

Whoever is beyond clinging, of past, present and future, who possesses and desires nothing, is released from this and all worlds."


"Attain to utmost Emptiness; cling single-heartedly to interior peace.

If one can understand and embrace all, one is capable of doing justice.

To be just is to be sovereign; to be sovereign is to be Heavenly; to be Heavenly is to be one with the Tao; those who are one with the Tao abide forever.

Such a one is safe and whole even after the dissolution of the body."

"When the Great Tao was abandoned, there appeared humanity and justice;
When intelligence and wit arose, there appeared great hypocrites;
When the six relations lost their harmony, there appeared filial piety and familial kindness.
When darkness and disorder begain to reign in the kingdom, there appeared loyal ministers."

How great is the difference between "eh" and "oh"?
What is the distinction between "good" and "evil"?
Must I fear what others fear? What abysmal nonsense!

All people are joyous and beaming, as though feasting and mounting the terrace;
I alone and placid and give no sign, like a babe that has not yet smiled; I alone am forlorn, like one who has no home.

All have enough, and to spare; I alone appear to possess nothing.

What a fool I am, how crazy I must be!
All people are so bright, I alone am dim;
All people are sharp, I alone am a fool;

Calm as the lake, aimless like the wind.

All people settle down, I alone am stubborn, and wander the wilderness.

Wherein I am most different from others, is in knowing how to take sustenance from my Divine Mother!"

"Tao is always nameless.

Small as it is in its Primal Simplicity, it is inferior to nothing;
If only a ruler could hold onto it, everything would pay homage.

Heaven and Earth would be harmonized, peace and order would reign among the people, without any command from above.

When once the Primal Simplicity diversified, the Different Things appeared - are there not enough names now?

Is this not the time to stop?

To know when to stop is to preserve ourselves from danger;

"One who holds the Great Symbol will attract all things; they flock to them and recieve no harm, for in them they find peace, security, and happiness.

Music and food can only make a passing guest pause;
But the words of Tao possess lasting effects, even though they are silent and flavorless."

"If I had even a tiny grain of wisdom, I should walk in the Way, and my only fear would be to stray from it.

The Great Way is smooth and straight; and yet people prefer their own paths.

"My words are easy to understand, and easy to practice;
But the world cannot understand them, nor practice them.

My words have an ancestor, my deeds have a Master.

People who have no knowledge of this, have no knowledge of me.

Only when we are sick of sickness, shall we cease to be sick.

The Sage is not sick, being sick of sickness - that is the secret of health."

if the thought of something arouses any negative emotion - anger, self-pity, frustration, regret - you are still attached.

do not get trapped in the idea of being a pure, conscious, enlightened, etc. being

the thoughts 'I've stopped growing', 'I've grown a lot', 'It's happening', 'It's not happening', etc. are all traps

pride, self-pity, hopelessness, meaninglessness, are all ultimately ego games

keep the goal in mind; do not become addicted to the method

"Good walking leaves no trace; 
Good speech leaves nothing to criticize;
Good calculation uses no paper;
Good security uses no locks;
The strongest bonds are not made of ropes and chains.

Hence, a Sage is good at saving people, therefore no one is abandoned; always good at saving things, and therefore nothing is wasted.

This is called following the guidance of the Inner Light.

one bound in cause and effect cannot liberate others

the only thing that will hold you back is your own pride and desire.

as you run out of desires, it is common to experience despair

every desire is an attempt to come closer to the light

anything created in time, passes in time; attachment to anything in time leads to suffering in time





















"Truly, we dwell in happiness:
Surrounded by those that hate, we do not;
Surrounded by those that are sick, we are not;
Surrounded by those who struggle, we are free;
Having no obstacles at all, we feed upon joy, like radiant gods.


- Accept that nothing is permanent except change; appreciate everything, cling to nothing.
- appreciate the journey of life and find peace and fulfillment in it


You wake up early every morning
Worrying about your earthly possessions, yes
(Don't make it hold ya)
In these obsessions

पाठ

أكتب هذا لأسباب عديدة.
أسعى إلى صفاء الذهن، وخفة القلب، وصدق الصوت.
إذا كان بإمكاني مساعدة روح واحدة بما هو مكتوب هنا،
فإنني لم أفعل ذلك عبثًا.

I write this for many reasons.
I seek clarity of mind, lightness of heart, and honesty of voice.
If I can help even one soul with what is written here,
I have not done so in vain.

...

I sought in my heart to know what was best, 
how we should live with our numbered days.
I gave my heart to know wisdom;
and to know madness and folly;
I saw that this, also, was like chasing after the wind.

For in much wisdom is much sadness: 
They who increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow.

One generation passeth away, and another generation comes;
but Earth and Heaven abide forever.
The Sun rises, and sets, and returns to rise again;
The rivers and streams run into the sea, and yet the sea is never full; 
And whence the rains and winds and waters come, there they return again.

There is more than anyone can know, let alone say. 
The eye can never see enough, nor the ears hear enough.

All that has been, is what shall be, and that which is done, is that which shall be done, and there is nothing new underneath the Sun;
And the Creator has set their words within all things,
So that none may know the breadth of their works, from beginning to end.

All things upon Earth have their season;
There is a time to every purpose under Heaven.

Go thy way, eat, drink, and be merry. Let your heart be light.

Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment;
For Death is a constant companion, a patient and silent friend.

Live in awe and gratitude, and make the most of the gift you have been given.
Live joyfully, surrounded by love, all the days of your life.

Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: 
Know the Creator, live in gratitude and joy, and walk in righteousness;
For this is the whole duty and birthright of humankind.


"


These are the words of Black Elk.
My friend, I am going to tell you the story of my life.
If it were only the story of my life, I would not tell it;
For what is one man, that he should make much of his winters,
even when they bend him like a heavy snow?
So many men have lived, and shall live,
To be grass upon the hills and fields.
It is a story of all life that is Wakan, and is good to tell,
Of us two-legged sharing in it, with the four-legged, and the wings of the air and fish of the waters, and all green things, for these are children of One Mother, and their Father is One Spirit...

It is the story of a mighty vision, given to a man, too weak to use it..

No good thing can be done by anyone alone,
I will make an offering to the spirit of the world, and ask it to help my voice be true.
I will smoke the sacred pipe, and first offer it to the powers that are One Power,
And I send my voice up with the smoke...
Grandfather, Great Spirit, you have been always, and before you, no one has been;
There is no other one to pray to but you; 
you yourself, everything that you see, everything has been made by you;
Hear me, four corners of the world, a relative I am; 
give me the strength to walk this good Earth, and be a good relative to all that is;
give me the eyes to see, and the strength to understand,
That I may be like you...
With your power only can I face the winds.
The voice I send is weak, yet with earnestness I have sent it, hear me.
It is finished.

Let us smoke, my friend, and let there be only good between us...


I saw more than I could understand, and understood more than I can say.


The Lord says: CC1

For seventeen generations I have been incarnated 1 as a high mandarin, and I have never oppressed my people nor maltreated my subordinates. I have helped them in misfortune; I have rescued them from poverty; I have taken compassion on their orphans; I have forgiven their transgressions; I have extensively practised secret virtue (yin chih  2) which is attuned to heaven above. CC2 If you are able to keep your hearts as I have kept mine, Heaven will surely bestow upon you blessings. Therefore, these are the instructions I declare unto mankind: 3

He who wants to expand the field of happiness, 4 let him lay the foundation of it on the bottom of his heart. CC7

Keep the ancient sages before your eyes even when at supper or while looking over the fence. 19

Be mindful when you are alone 14 in the shadow of your coverlet. 20

Anything evil refrain ye from doing; CC14 all good deeds do! 21 So will you be released forever from the influence of evil stars, and always be encompassed by good guardian angels. 22

Rewards may be immediate, and you will receive them in person, or rewards may be remote, and will devolve upon your posterity.

Blessings come a hundredfold in loads as if drawn by horses; good fortune is piled up a thousandfold like a mass of clouds.

Do not all these things accrue to the heart of the quiet way?


1. MAN'S INDEBTEDNESS TO THE LORD.
The Lord Superior takes compassion on the ignorance of all sentient beings, who are unable to liberate themselves from the curse of their karma. So he proclaims these moral instructions, thereby to lead to enlightenment the generations to come.

His love is greater than that of a father who instructs his children; his discipline is greater than that of a master who trains his disciples. How sincere, earnest, and kindhearted are his words! They are surely the road that leads to sainthood and enlightenment, the best method that avoids misfortune and rescues us from evil.

May people who receive these instructions exert all their mental energy to put them in practice and be attuned to the Great Lord's boundless love to save the world.

2. HEAVEN AND EARTH. 1
Chou-tze says: "Heaven and Earth are constantly at work to regenerate the ten thousand things. That

p. 26

is their purport. If the thought of a person is always bent on benefiting others, then he becomes himself Heaven and Earth.

"It is not sufficient for an officer of high position to refrain from coveting promotion and from seeking wealth. He should employ his benevolence so as to benefit his fellow men; otherwise the purpose for which Heaven has created us will be altogether lost."

A GOOD JUDGE. 1
In olden times, Yü King, judge of the criminal court, was held in such high esteem [on account of his virtue] that a gateway for four-horse carriages was erected in his honor.

Yü King of the Han dynasty (206 B. C. to A. D. 23) was judge of a criminal court on the eastern shore of China. In his district there was a young widow who, on account of her parental devotion, showed no disposition to marry again, lest her mother-in-law be left without support. The aged woman, however, was so much distressed over her helplessness that finally she hanged herself to release her daughter-in-law from the duty of self-sacrifice. Her own daughter hearing of the incident went to court and charged her sister-in-law with murder, and the latter, unable to vindicate herself, was condemned to death in spite of Yü King's

p. 27

protest. After this tragedy, Heaven failed to give rain all along the eastern coast for a period of three years. When a new governor was installed, Yü King explained to him the cause of the long drought. Thereupon the grave of the dutiful daughter-in-law was officially decorated, and then at last it started to rain.

Yü King showed his humane disposition in many other trials. When the elder people in his district proposed to repair his family gate which was dilapidating, Yü King advised them to have it raised and enlarged, so that a four-horse carriage could be driven through it, saying: "I have a great many times in my official life practised secret virtue (yin teh) and have never condemned the innocent. Among my descendants there will surely be some one who will rise high and will occupy important positions." And so things came to pass. His son became prime minister and was created a noble, and his grandson, too, was promoted to a responsible position in the government.

HUMANENESS REWARDED. 1
The Tou family saved people and thus nobly obtained the five-branched olea. 2

Tou Yü-Chün was not yet favored with a son when he was thirty years old. One night his grandfather appeared to him in a dream and said: "You may not have any issue at all, nor may you live long, unless you are diligent in performing benevolent deeds."

p. 28

Yü-Chün was a well-to-do man and could afford to do many benevolent things. One of his servants stole a considerable sum of money from his chest. When the fact was exposed, the guilty one fled leaving his daughter thirteen years old, to whom a note was attached which read: "Offer this girl and my house for sale. With the money thus realized I wish to pay my debt."

Yü-Chün burned the note, took the girl to his own house, and had her reared by his wife. When she reached maturity he gave her a large dowry and chose for her a good husband. When her father heard of it he was greatly affected and returned home full of repentance. His old master forgave him and did not say anything about his former crime.

Yü-Chün did many other good things. The poor who could not afford funeral services for their dead, were liberally assisted by him, and those who could not, on account of a lack of dowry, give their daughters in marriage, were handsomely supplied with gold. Poor children were educated and the helpless taken care of, while he himself lived most frugally. He also built a large library and gave employment to many learned men.

In the meantime he saw again his grandfather in a dream, who said: "You were originally destined not to have any offspring and to live only a few more years. But on account of your humane deeds, your merits have been recorded by the Heavenly Lord. Your life will be prolonged and you will have five children who will be very prosperous."

"The way of Yin and Yang," the spirit added, "is like the law of Karma. The reward may become manifest either in this life or in succeeding lives. The

p. 29

heavenly net is vast and hangs loosely, but it never permits things to escape. You must cherish no doubt about this."

Yü-Chün's five sons successfully passed the literary examinations and were promoted to high official positions.

5. SAVING MANY LIVES. 1
He who took pity on ants attained the highest literary honor.

Sung Chiao and Sung Ch'i (eleventh century A. D.) were brothers. When they were both at college, a strange Buddhist monk examined their physiognomy and prophesied: "The younger Sung will be the first on the list of literary graduates, and the elder, too, will unfailingly pass."

Ten years later, the elder Sung again happened to meet the monk on the road. The monk showed great astonishment, exclaiming: "Your fortunes have suddenly changed. You look as if you had saved millions of lives." Sung said, laughing: "How could I, a poor follower of Confucius, achieve such a feat as that?" "Yes," replied the monk, "Even the meanest creatures are enjoying their lives you know." Reflecting a little while, Sung said: "I remember that about ten days ago I found an ants' nest under my porch in danger of being flooded. I took a few bamboo sticks and made a bridge over the water to let the poor ants cross over it. May this be it?" "Exactly," answered the monk, "the younger Sung is now leading the list but you will not be second to him."

When the order of literary graduates was declared,

p. 30

the younger Sung was found to be the first and the elder Sung the second. But the Empress Chang Hsien decreed that the younger brother should not precede the elder, and Sung Chiao was put at the head of the list.

6. THE DOUBLE-HEADED STAKE. 1
He who buried [out of sight] the snake [of bad omen] was deemed worthy of the honor of premiership.

Shun Shu-Ao, of Chu state, when a boy, used to go out very frequently. One day he saw a double-headed snake which he killed and to put it out of sight, buried it in the ground. He came home in gloom and showed no appetite at the table. An anxious inquiry of his mother brought him to tears, and he said mournfully: "People say, those who have seen a double-headed snake are doomed to die soon. I saw one to-day and fear that before long I shall die, mother, and will have to leave you alone." The mother then asked him, "Where is the snake now?" "Fearing that others might see it too, I killed and buried it." "Never mind then," replied the mother, "you will not die. I understand that secret virtue (yin teh) brings rewards that are open. Where there is virtue, thither will be gathered a thousand blessings. Where there is benevolence, a hundred evils are distanced. Heaven above attends to affairs below. You are sure to become eminent in this state."

When Shun was a man, he was made a minister of state.

p. 31

7. THE FOUNDATION OF BLISS
All deeds originate in the heart 2

All the good acts that are enumerated below begin in the heart and are completed, too, in the heart. The heart's inmost recess is the very spot where there is Heaven and where there is Hell.

The difference between sages such as Yao and Shun and wretches such as Chieh or Chou, simply pivots here around this puny little thing. Unexpected blessings grow, as it were, in a very actual field, which can be ploughed and harvested. The heart, though spiritual and mysterious, yet possesses a solid, tangible soil, which can be watered and tilled.

The soul of a true, earnest gentleman 3 has its root in this obscure recess, which he examines and purifies in solemn silence and privacy. Merely this, a heart to save the world; not one mote of a heart for worldliness. Merely this, a heart to love mankind; not a mote of a heart for hatred of people. Merely this, a heart to have respect for others; not a mote of a heart for making light of the world. Merely this, a heart earnestly to promote one's conversion; not a mote of a heart for indulgent self-delusion. This is the way of self-purification and the sure foundation of bliss.

p. 32

8. SEEK TRUTH FOR THE SAKE OF SALVATION.
Ch'ang-tze says: "If a respectable gentleman is at all disposed towards lovingkindness, he cannot help doing things beneficial to others." Supplementing this, Ch'en An-Shan says: "If a villain is ever bent on selfishness, he will surely do things harmful to others." Both of these sayings are indisputably true.

Those who are able to think of others are called superior men, and those who think of themselves are called small men. The difference is in one's own fundamental thought, whether it is of the ego or not. Some incessantly accumulate evils, others good deeds; and when we see the result, it is the difference between Heaven and Earth.

Li Kwang-Yüen, an eminent seeker of truth, was once warned by a strange saintly personage, thus: "I see thou art seeking truth. But wouldst thou have it for thy private self, saints and gods will have no regard for thee." Are not gods and saints 4 as well as sages and holy men 5 bent on saving the world? Some seek saintliness in their pursuit of life everlasting and immortality; but if their hearts are tainted with a single thought of egotism, they are grievously at fault, though it be hidden and they know it not; and there is no thought of their ever attaining to saintship.

9. THE DISEASE OF EGOTISM.
Mother Cheng used to instruct her children to this effect: "When others do good, fall in line as if it were your work and be sure to bring it to completion. Treat

p. 33

others' property as if it were your own, so you will be thoughtful in using it."

Hsieh Wen-Ching says: "The reason why a man has thousands of troubles is because he clings to the idea of self: therefore, he schemes and contrives in ten thousand different ways. He alone wants to be rich, he alone wants to be honored, he alone wants to be easy, he alone wants to be happy, he alone wants to enjoy life, he alone wants to be blessed with longevity; and to others' poverty, misery, danger, or suffering, be is altogether indifferent. It is for this reason that the life-will 6 of others is disregarded and Heaven's Reason neglected. Only be cured of the disease of egotism, and your heart will be broadened even to the vastness of infinite space, so that wealth, honor, happiness, comfort, health, longevity could all be enjoyed with others. And, then, the will to live will have its way, everything will have its natural longings satisfied, and Heaven's Reason will be displayed in an untold exuberance.

10. FILIAL PIETY.
Filial piety is the guide of all actions. It is the ultimate root of humaneness; and is it possible that the root be rotten while the branches and leaves grow luxuriously?

p. 34

Yao-Jao Hou says: "The four essential elements of filial piety are: (1) To be established in virtue; (2) To keep up the family; (3) To keep the body unimpaired; (4) To cultivate the character."

Pious children will not let their parents' hearts be roused to thoughts of cold indifference. They will not let their parents' hearts be annoyed or harassed. They will not let their parents' hearts be alarmed or filled with fear. They will not let their parents' hearts be grieved or embarrassed. They will not let their parents' hearts be perplexed. They will not let their parents' hearts feel ashamed or indignant.

11. SEVERAL WAYS.
In his anxiety lest all people might not be induced to goodness, the Lord Superior invites them to come to him in any way they may be pleased to follow. They may pay homage at the Taoist sanctuary; they may worship the Northern Constellation; they may bow before the Buddha and recite his Sutras: if they only do so with singleness and sincerity of heart, these roads will lead to goodness; but there should be no thought of attaining blessings or acquiring rewards.

12. BUDDHISM AND CONFUCIANISM.
P'an Ch'ung-Mou says:

"What is to be avoided most in our life is vacillation and frivolity (wang nien); and what is most excellent is a reverential heart. Therefore, we Confucians endeavor to preserve sincerity of heart and consider reverence as most essential. It is needless

p. 35

to say that sincerity and reverence make us companions of heaven and earth, gods and spirits.

"There is, however, another class of people who adopt Buddhism as their guidance. They bow before the Buddha and recite his Sutras, always bent on preserving reverence and awe. They will never relax their vigilant guard over the heart, which will by degrees become pure and bright, free from evil thoughts and ready to do good. This enlightenment is called their most happy land. 7 What is necessary, then, for Buddhists as well as Confucians is to avoid vacillation and frivolity, which will render you unreliable. Keep the heart always restrained by reverence and awe. Otherwise what can be the use of the recitation of Sutras or the discourses of Confucius?"

13. A SYMPATHETIC HEART.
The great virtue of heaven and earth is to create, and all living beings, men and animals alike, derive their vitality from this one and the same source. Nowhere under the sun is there a being that dislikes life and embraces death with joy.

To buy up captive animals for the sake of setting them free is nothing but an outburst of a sympathetic heart. Thoughtless people make light of puny creatures such as ants, spiders, etc., and wantonly kill them, having no thought of pity or remorse; but pious hearts refrain from such cruelty.

p. 36

14. THE VOICE WITHIN 8
"Heaven's Reason consists of two words; but they are in your own heart. If when you do a thing, there remains in your heart some misgiving, then your deed is against Heaven and contrary to Reason. A virtuous man punctiliously guards himself when alone, solely to retain Heaven's Reason 9 and to calm human desires. Therefore says Tung Ch'ung-Shu [a famous Confucian]: "Attend to your duty and scheme not for gain. Look after what you ought to do and measure not your merit."

The source of good and evil is in the heart, and the best method of controlling it is a reverential attitude of the heart.

Ever turbulent is the heart of him who does evil; ever wakeful is the heart of him who does good.

The teachings of holy men are written in the six canonical books. There are thousand gates and ten thousand doors; through which shall we enter? The main thing is to guard oneself when alone, lest one go astray; then you will see how one's strength grows.

Proceed in goodness for a thousand days and there will be not enough; proceed in evil for half a minute and you will have too much.


THE Exalted One says:[3] (1-3)

Curses and blessings do not come through gates,[4] but man himself invites their arrival.[5] (4-11)

The reward of good and evil is like the shadow accompanying a body, and so it is apparent[6] that heaven and earth are possessed of crime-recording spirits. (12-28)

According to[7] the lightness or gravity of his transgressions,[8] the sinner's term of life is reduced. Not only is his term of life reduced, but poverty[9] also strikes him. Often he meets with calamity and misery.[9] His neighbors[10] hate him. Punishments and curses pursue him. Good luck shuns him. Evil stars threaten him; and when his term of life comes to an end, he perishes. (29-67)


The right way leads forward; the wrong way backward.[19] (148-155)

Do not proceed on an evil path. (156-159)

Do not sin[20] in secret.[21] (160-163)

Accumulate virtue, increase merit. (164-167)

With a compassionate heart turn toward all creatures. (168-171)

Be faithful, filial, friendly, and brotherly.[22] (172-175)

First rectify thyself and then convert others. (176-179)

{p. 53}

Take pity on orphans, assist widows; respect the old, be kind to children. (180-187)

Even the multifarious insects, herbs, and trees should not be injured. (188-195)

Be grieved at the misfortune of others and rejoice at their good luck. (196-204)

Assist those in need, and rescue those in danger. (205-212)

Regard your neighbor's gain as your own gain, and regard your neighbor's loss as your own loss. (213-228)

Do not call attention to the faults of others, nor boast of your own excellence. (229-236)

Stay evil and promote goodness. (237-240)

Renounce much, accept little. (241-244)

Show endurance in humiliation and bear no grudge. (245-248)

Receive favors as if surprised.[23] (249-252)

Extend your help without seeking reward. (253-257)

Give to others and do not regret or begrudge your liberality. (258-262)


Those who are thus, are good: people honor them; Heaven's Reason[24] gives them grace[25]; blessings and abundance follow them; all ill luck keeps away[26]; angel spirits guard them. What

{p. 54}

ever they undertake will surely succeed, and even to spiritual saintliness[27] they may aspire. (263-294)

Those who wish to attain heavenly saintliness, should perform one thousand three hundred good deeds, and those who wish to attain to earthly saintliness should perform three hundred good deeds. (295-316)


Yet[28] there are some people whose behavior is unrighteous. (317-322)

Their deportment is irrational.[29] (323-326)

In evil they delight.[30] (327-330)

With brutality they do harm and damage. (331-334)

Insidiously they injure the good and the law-abiding. (335-338)

Stealthily they despise their superiors and parents. (339-342)

They disregard their seniors and rebel against those whom they serve. (343-350)

They deceive the uninformed. (351-354)

They slander their fellow-students. (355-358)

Liars they are, bearing false witness, deceivers, and hypocrites; malevolent exposers of kith and kin[31]; mischievous and malignant; not humane; cruel and irrational; self-willed. (359-374)

{p. 55}

Right and wrong they confound. Their avowals and disavowals are not as they ought to be.[32] (375-382)

They oppress their subordinates and appropriate their merit. (383-386)

They cringe to superiors to curry favor. (387-390)

Insentient to favors received, they remember their hatred and are never satisfied. (391-398)

They hold in contempt the lives of Heaven's people.[33] (399-402)

They agitate and disturb the public order. (403-406)

If the Tao is separated from the soul, you will transmigrate through the six domains and keep on the three paths,[1] but if the soul and the Tao are united, you will finally reach paradise and the land of immortals. Hell and heaven are in your own heart. Unless heaven reside within you, the mere reading or reciting of sacred books profiteth nothing."
