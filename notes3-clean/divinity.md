DIVINITY 

Honor Creation, and the Creator.
Creator and Creation; Lover and Beloved.

There is only one Creator, that has created all things. 
Nothing exists outside of what the Creator has made. 
And so - we make peace with that Creator, and all Creation.
The air and clouds above, the snow, rain, hail, sleet, fog, lightning and thunder;
The earth beneath us, the fire, the water, the plants and animals, humankind;
Made in Circles, moving in Circles, Circles within Circles.

The Creator has placed power in all things;
And so we respect and revere all of Creation, even ourselves, and one another. 
We live a sacred existence, where all things are connected; there are no coincidences.

All phenomena, tangible and intangible things, all beings, are an emanation of the Creator, and are therefore sacred.

Embrace Earth and Heaven, follow the natural cycles of Life and Death.

All things are within the Circle, the Sacred Hoop.
The known universe, the galaxies, black holes, the stars, moons, and planets, all are formed in spheres and circles, and travel in circles and spirals.

The days, nights, and seasons move in circles; air, water, earth, and fire move in circles.

Birth, growth, transformation, decay, and death are a circle.

All beliefs, all paths, lead to the One.

Being sacred, every living and nonliving thing is a universe unto itself.

We share one world, one star, one galaxy, one reality. We are all family.

Trust in yourself, in others, in the world around you, in the Creator.
Faith is what makes change and miracles possible.

There is no reason to turn away from the material world, it is no less sacred. 
Turn towards the unseen, towards Spirit, not out of aversion to the mundane, but out of love for the Divine.

As the universe continues to expand and evolve, so does Life, and Consciousness.

"We are the universe experiencing itself"

All things have innate consciousness, the imprint of consciousness, being created from the First Consciousness, and therefore exist.

There is nothing real except the Creator;
All worlds and beings are part of the Great Spirit.

Create within yourself a sacred place, of peace and stillness; find an altar there, ask any blessing, and it wil be given to you.

Going against Divine Law inbalances the elemental forces of Nature

All things, including healing, come from the Source, the Divine

The Soul is Eternal, we go out, and come in again

The Soul enters a living body of its own desire

"There needs to be, in one's life, knowledge of the power of God, and God's work in the affairs of mankind"

"to one who has had the experience, no explanation is necessary;
to one who has not, an explanation is not possible.""

"once you realize God knows everything, you are free"

"who we are is beyond all this"

had ye faith, ye could move mountains - Jesus

one can only stand in total awe of such a divine plan, and experience much compassion about the poignancy of others' petty concerns about power

guru, god, and self, are one - ramana maharshi

the influence of god is obscured by one's thoughts and actions

how does a devotee realize his true being with help from god?
it is like waking from seeing something in a dream

cosmic humor is an important part of the journey

all that you enjoy, enjoy in my name,
all that you suffer, suffer in my name,
in this way, you will be free, and come to me - bhagavad gita

all of the finite knowledge of reality does not add up to the sum of its parts


there seems no plan because it is all planned,
there seems to be no center because it is all the center

bhakti yoga, union through love and devotion; the means is dualistic, the end is One; lover and beloved become one

see beyond the veils of personality and body, beyond separations and illusions - see yourself and others as the Divine Beings you are

play your role in the divine dance!

god knows all that you do; understands your predicaments with compassion..

our sins are made in secrecy; once we realize god knows our thoughts, we are free

god respects me when I work, but loves me when I sing - R. Tagore

god alone is real; unite with them through love - meher baba

when one believes god is outside, they walk to a temple;
when one believes god is inside, they dance

all beings are manifestations of the one

that which sees through the eye, but thom the eye cannot see, that is atman

I am without form or limit, beyond space and time;
I am in everything, everything is me
I am the bliss of the universe, I am a butterfly

either through intuition or reason, one arrives at the conclusion they are part of God, made by, touched by, God

the whole game is based on faith

karma yoga; realizing all things are sacred

the miracles performed by my god are not the essence of their teachings, but they, at least, can be talked about

there is a universal consciousness, a level and frequency;
blessed are they that have not seen, and yet believe

the guru is the way; they are ready when you are

you cannot have an interpersonal relationship with a being that is, by nature, not interpersonal

god sees all your thoughts, good and bad, whether you like it or not

once you know there's nowhere to hide, you begin to wonder, who am I hiding from?; everywhere I go, the chicken sees

we are love

god knows everything, and loves you anyway; god is love

balanced between form and emptiness, existing in love, sahaj samadhi

les ye see miracles, ye will not believe 

where there is faith, there is the presence; you are already enlightened

how can you relate to something when it is you, and everything you have experienced, ever will experience?

when you know how to listen, everyone is god

atman; you are the laws of the universe

going home; going om; returning to roots; 
I and my father are One

here is where it all is; where it all happens; where you need to go

the eternal present

the divine dance; no one is coming from, or going to, anywhere

there is nowhere to go, nothing to do; everything is irrelevant

nothing is happening, no matter what is happening

"The Tao can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao;
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name.

As the origin of Heaven and Earth, it is nameless;
As the Divine Mother, it is nameable.

As it is ever hidden, we should look at its inner essence;
As it is always manifest, we should look at its outer aspects.

These two flow from the same source, though differently named; both are called mysteries.

The Mystery of Mysteries is the Door of All Essence."

"It lies in the nature of Grand Virtue to follow the Tao and the Tao alone. 

Now, what is the Tao?

It is something elusive and evasive, evasive and elusive!

And yet it contains within itself a form; a substance, a core of vitality..
It contains within itself an unfailing sincerity.

Throughout the ages its Name has been preserved in order to recall the Beginning of all things.

How do I know the ways of all things at the Beginning?
Because of what is within me."

"There was something undefined and yet complete in itself, born before Heaven and Earth.

Silent and boundless, standing alone without change, yet pervading all without fail, it may be regarded as the Mother of the world.

I do not know its name, I style it Tao, and in the absence of a better word, call it 'The Great'.

To be great is to go on, to go on is to be far, to be far is to return.

Hence, the Tao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, the king is great. 

Man follows the ways of Earth, the Earth follows the ways of Heaven, Heaven follows the ways of Tao, and Tao follows its own ways."

"Tao gives them life, virtue nurses them, matter shapes them, environment perfects them, therefore all things without exception worship Tao and pay homage to Virtue.

They have not been commanded to worship Tao and pay homage to Virtue, but they always do so spontaneously.

It is Tao that gives them life, it is Virtue that nurses them, grows them, fosters them, shelters them, comforts them, nourishes them, covers them under her wings.

To give life but to claim nothing, to do your work but to set no store by it, to be a leader, not a butcher, this is called Hidden Virtue."

"All under Heaven have a common Beginning;
This Beginning is the Mother of the World.
Having known the Mother, we may proceed to know her children.
Having known the children, we should go back and hold onto the Mother; in so doing, you will incur no risk, even though your body be annihilated.

"The Great Tao is universal like a flood;
How can it be turned aside?

All things depend on it, and it denies nothing.

It does its work but makes no claim.

It clothes and feeds all things, but does not hold it over them.

All things return to it; because it does not wish to be great, its greatness is fully realized.

the message of your being is reflected in all your manifestations

I am writing but 'I' am not writing

you can't have, reject, or put away the Divine Mother - all you can do is honor her

Between Heaven and Earth, there seems to be a bellows; it is empty, and yet inexhaustible; the more it works, the more comes out of it; no amount of words can fathom it - better look for it within."

 no one can truly claim enlightenment until 'they' cease to exist as a singular entity.

listen to your Inner Voice; it will tell you all you need to know

the divine consciousness guiding you in whatever form you need to evolve

'As soon as one is alone with God, they are alone with them no matter where they are...
Lightning flashes, illuminating the horizon, striking where it pleases, and at the same instant, the infinity of God flashes in the depths of someone's soul, and they are illuminated.
At the very moment, one sees that, though they seem to be in the middle of their journey, they have already arrived at the end; for te life of grace upon Earth is the beginning of life in Heaven, and although they are a traveler in time and space, they have opened their eyes in eternity.' - Merton

'Ask, and it shall be given;
Seek, and ye shall find;
Knock, and the door shall be opened.' - Jesus

how do you ask your inner self something?
you are that; tat tvam asi; one can only meet god and other people as much as they are ready to meet themselves

my god is pure essence; they taught me everything I was ready to learn; they never explained anything; the relationship had nothing to do with the world

god has no attachment; you are your own god; you're hanging out with yourself; god is a mirror - there is no one there

you're ready when you're ready;
you see god when you're ready;
otherwise you see nothing at all

Having myself realized all, whom shall I call my teacher?

Vast is Heaven's net;
Sparse-meshed it is, and yet nothing can slip through it."

The Body is the Temple of the Most High...you and all living things are Sacred!


"why does Mahara-ji never talk to me about the bad things I think, say, and do?" 
"it does not help your sadhana. he knows it all - but only does what will help you."

an enlightened, conscious being, can appear in any form or occupation in order to help others; such people, through their acts, strengthen others' belief in humanity and the divine.

become beauty; embrace the ten thousand visions, become one with the universe; all of the energy passes through you, you are all energy; it is from the inner place in our heart, where we are, and always have been, and always will be, watching the entire drama that is our lives with unbearable compassion

there is something inside each of us that comes from beyond the veil; somewhere inside, everyone knows that theres is a place which is a state of total fulfillment, and through despair and surrender, you come closer to it

absolute surrender; the key to eternal union; becoming part of the endless patterns of energy

when you see your life as unfoldment, the moment to moment ego involvement of "Am I Getting Enough" disappears, and you egin to live in Spirit

To become a perfect channel, one needs perfect method, and a deep desire.


How many lives, how many rounds of rebirth have I experienced, without finding the architect of this house?
Now I see you; all of your rafters are broken, the ridgepole shattered, never again need you build a house for me.

"Become a knower of the uncreated.

The Tao is to the world what a great river or an ocean is to the streams and brooks."

"Tao gave birth to the One, the One gave birth to Two, the Two gave birth to Three, and the Three gave birth to the ten thousand myriad things...

All things carry Yin on their backs, and hold Yang in their arms, deriving vital harmony from the proper blending of the two vital breaths.

"The Tao is the hidden reservoir of all things.
It is a treasure to the honest, a safeguard to those who err.

consciousness is energy, awareness, light, truth;
any trip you want to take leads to the same place

The Sage embraces the One, and becomes part of the Way of Heaven.

an emancipated soul lives in the world like a bird diving into water and flying away - aurobindo

the divine work - revealing the profane as sacred

one who has become one with the clear light is said to be sat chit ananda; complete awareness and bliss

what difference is there between observer and observed

that which sees through the eye but whom the eye sees not; that is the Atman - mundaka upanishad


the universe is consciousness; you are only a tiny part of it, caught in a necessary illusion of spearation in order to develop and grow

drop into reality

beyond conceiving of a place you can go beyond;
you must die to get to the destination
you will die, but the essence will get through

no accidents or coincidences; you are a totally determined being; no miracles

paradox; as soon as you give it all up, you can have it all; only when you know who you are, will you know what is possible

I still wanted to know that I knew; all you'll ever find is yourself;
you only ever read to, talk to, and know, yourself; that's all there is

suddenly I dig who I am when I am stoned and high, I am out of time and space; it feels like the first real thing that has ever happened to me, except my suffering

pleasure, pain, loss, gain, fame, shame, it's all the same;
it's all just happening

you're standing on a bridge, watching yourself go by

you can be it all, but you can't know it all, and that's okay! as long as there is knower and known, there is dualism


in order to truly become one with all things, you must lose yourself


if the body is a temple, then everywhere you go is holy


Many souls reincarnate into the same family trees


The Body is the Temple of the Most High.


"since you no longer have any image or investment in yourself as a separate entity, all of your actions are in harmony with the forces acting upon the moment, and you live within the Tao"


our body is the temple where we do the work of purification and enlightenment

offer every act to the service of higher consciousness; our every act becomes an act of waking up

using daily life to bring yourself closer to union is karma yoga

live daily life as an act of worship

you may disagree with and dislike someone, but they are no less a divine being than you are.

Mahāmudrā, that which is unified and beyond the mind, is clear yet thoughtless, pervasive, and vast like space. Its aspect of great compassion is apparent yet devoid of any nature. Manifesting clearly like the moon in water; It is beyond all terms, boundaries or center. Polluted by nothing, it is stainless and beyond hope and fear. It cannot be described, like the dream of a mute.

When the tail of the tadpole drops off, it can live both in water and on land. When the tail of ignorance drops off, man becomes free. He can then live both in God and in the world equally well.

You see many stars in the sky at night, but not when the sun rises. Can you therefore say that there are no stars in the heavens during the day? O man, because you cannot find God in the days of your ignorance, say not that there is no God.

Samadhi is the state of bliss which is experienced by a live fish which, being kept out of water for some time, is again put into it.

So long as God seems to be outside and far away, there is ignorance. But when God is realised within, that is true knowledge.

Man cannot really help the world. God alone does that — He who has created the sun and the moon, who has put love for their children in parents' hearts, endowed noble souls with compassion, and holy men and devotees with divine love. The man who works for others, without any selfish motive, really does good to himself. There is gold buried in your heart, but you are not yet aware of it. It is covered with a thin layer of earth. Once you are aware of it, all these activities of yours will lessen. … Through selfless work, love of God grows in the heart. Then, through His grace, one realizes Him in course of time. God can be seen, one can talk to Him, as I am talking to you.

It is one and the same Avatara that, having plunged into the ocean of life, rises up in one place and is known as Krishna, and diving again rises in another place and is known as Christ.
- Ramakrishna

Surrender can never be regarded as complete so long as the devotee wants this or that from the Lord. True surrender is the love of God for the sake of love and nothing else, not even for the sake of salvation. In other words, complete effacement of the ego is necessary to conquer destiny, whether you achieve this effacement through Self-enquiry or through bhakti marga. - Ramana Maharshi

This is the great lesson that we are here to learn through myriads of births and heavens and hells — that there is nothing to be asked for, desired for, beyond one’s spiritual Self (atman).

The Self when it appears behind the universe is called God. The same Self when it appears behind this little universe — the body — is the soul.

All that is real in me is God; all that is real in God is I. The gulf between God and me is thus bridged. Thus by knowing God, we find that the kingdom of heaven is within us.

Every individual is a center for the manifestation of a certain force. This force has been stored up as the resultant of our previous works, and each one of us is born with this force at our back.

Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and in every living being?

You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.

The moment I have realized God sitting in the temple of every human body, the moment I stand in reverence before every human being and see God in him — that moment I am free from bondage, everything that binds vanishes, and I am free.

After so much austerity I have known that the highest truth is this: He is present in every being! These are all in manifold forms of him. There is no other God to seek for! He alone is worshipping God, who serves all beings!
- Swami Vivekenanda

Heaven can be high because of it, earth can hold everything because of it, the Polar Star can have its majesty because of it, the sun and the moon can make constant illumination because of it, the five constant elements 58 can keep their positions constant because of it, all the stars can keep their orbits right because of it, the four seasons can control their diverse expressions because of it, Hsien-yüan could rule over the four directions at his discretion because of it, Master Red Pine 59 could live 60 as long as heaven and earth because of it, and sages can compose essays and elaborate institutions because of it. 

It was manifested in the wisdom of Yao and Shunm in the rampancy of Chieh-yü, 61 in the destruction of Chieh and Chow, and in the prosperity of T`ang and Wu. 

Near as you might suppose it to be, it travels to the four poles of the world. 
Far as you might suppose it to be, it always abides by the side of everybody. 
Dim as you might suppose it to be, its gleam is glittering. 
Bright as you might suppose it to be, its body is obscure. 

By its achievement heaven and earth are formed. 
By its harmony thundering is transformed. 

Thus everything in the world owes it its formation. 

By nature the inner reality of Tao is neither restrained nor embodied. 

It is either soft or weak according as the occasion is, and is always in correspondence with principles. 

Because of it everything dies. Thanks to it everything lives. 

Because of it every affair fails. Thanks to it every affair succeeds. 

Tao can be compared to water. 
Who is drowning, dies as he drinks too much of it. 
Who is thirsty lives on as he drinks a proper amount of it. 

Again, it can be compared to a sword or a spear. 62 
If the stupid man uses it for wreaking his grudge upon others, calamities will happen. 
If the saintly man uses it for punishing the outrageous, good luck will ensue. 
Thus, people die of it, live owing to it, fail because of it, and succeed on account of it.


- respect our connection to the divine source of creation

"The Tao is like an empty bowl, which in being used, can never be filled up.

Fathomless, it seems to be the origin of all things.

It blunts all sharp edges, unties all tangles, harmonizes all lights, unites the world into one whole.

Hidden in the depths, it seems to exist forever.

I do not know whose child it is; it seems to be the ancestor of all things."

"The Spirit of the Fountain dies not;
It is called the Mysterious Feminine.

The Doorway to the Mysterious Feminine is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Lingering like gossamer, it has only a hint of existence, and yet when you draw upon it, it is inexhaustible."

"The movement of the Tao consists in Returning; the use of the Tao consists in softness.

Have you ever been (Have you ever been?)
To Electric Ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you
So don't you be late, oh

Electric woman waits for you and me

Conquering the stumbling blocks come easier
When the conqueror is in tune with the infinite

A higher wisdom is at work for you

The oak sleeps in the acorn
The giant sequoia tree sleeps in its tiny seed
The bird waits in the egg
God waits for his unfoldment in man
Fly on, children
Play on


There is no chance, coincidence or accident
In a world ruled by law and divine order
You rise as high as your dominant aspiration
You descend to the level of your lowest concept of your self


Preacher man don't tell me
Heaven is under the earth
I know you don't know
What life is really worth
He said all that glitters is gold

But you can't fool all the people all the time
So now we see the light (watch you gon' do?)
We gonna stand up for our rights (yeah, yeah)


We'll be forever loving Jah


Give thanks and praises to the Most-I (Jah!);

And in Ham is known to be the Prophet.

And I'm worrying to be free, desperately, yeah.
So guide and protect I'n'I, O Jah - Jah,
Through all these ages;
Guide and protect I'n'I, O Jah - Jah,
Through all these stages.
