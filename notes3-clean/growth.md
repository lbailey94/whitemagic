GROWTH 

All people are born with different hearts, to different families, in different circumstances.

Some are born with good hearts, others are cruel as children;
Some change along the way, and some remain the same.

All people live different lives, experiencing fortune and misfortune, love and rejection, validation and discouragement.

What is right in one household is wrong in another;
What is right in one church is heresy in another;
What is right in one teaching is incorrect in another;
What one culture finds delicious, another finds disgusting;
What some see as mundane, others find profound.

Is there any wonder why there is confusion and conflict?

Whether one is curious or indifferent, intuitive or unaware, empathetic or cold, can often be traced back to peope, places, events in their life.

Celebrate our individual and collective differences; they are the key to solving all of our problems.

Be open and accepting of all perspectives and experiences.

The circumstances of our birth and situations we find ourselves in are irrelevant; how we react and grow is what defines us, even after we are gone.

We transform through the acceptance of love, and by overcoming adversity.

"Patience is the most beautiful virtue, and the least understood"

All people have potential, but lack faith in themselves, others, and their Creator

"A single wise word that brings peace, is worth more than a thousand speeches of empty words.

A verse full of meaning that brings peace to the listener is worth more than a thousand songs of empty words.

One may recite an entire book or sutra, but a single hymn that brings peace is worth far more.

One may conquer a million men in battle,
The greatest warriorsconquer themselves.

Conquest of self is the greatest victory,
No one can deprive such a person of glory.

The honor paid to one who has mastered themselves, is worth more than thousand taels of gold, worth more than tending a sacred fire for a lifetime.

Making offerings for glory and recognition, is worth nothing compared to honoring the righteous.

Whoever shows reverence and respect for elders is rewarded fourfold.

Even a single day lived virtuously, is worth more than a lifetime of worldly achievement.

A single day of reflective contemplation is worth more than a lifetime of idleness and ignorance.

A single day lived by one who grasps the ephemeral nature of all things is worth more than a lifetime spent chasing blindly after material fortune and fame.

A single day lived by one who sees the truth is worth more than a lifetime lived not seeing it."

"You are now like a withering leaf, death coming closer.
Although at the point of departure, you have not prepared yourself.

You have reached the end, you stand face to face with death,
You have no place to rest upon the road.

Prepare a refuge, work hard, use good judgement.
Free of flaws and passions, you shall enter the highest realms.
You need never return to the cycles of birth and death.

The wise one, carefully, moment by moment, one by one, eliminates the stains on their mind.

Just as rust corrodes iron, so is a sinner destroyed by their own wrong actions.

One who gives with a grudge loses their generosity.
Deeds done with ill intent are forever stained.

Eliminate ignorance, and purity follows.

Life is easy for one who is shameless, aggressive, arrogant, intrusive, corrupt.

Life is not easy for one who is modest, with high values, free from attachment, humble, of right livelihood, with clear vision.

Whoever in this world takes life, lies, steals, commits adultery, is addicted to drinking poison, is digging up their own roots.

Be aware, that those flawed in their nature have no control of themselves. Do not let greed and anger cause you suffering.

People give for many reasons, such as devotion or appreciation.
Whoever finds fault, will have no peace.

Whoever gives up their habit of finding fault, will know peace.

There is no fire like lust, no vice like hatred, no trap like delusion, no river like desire.

It is easy to see the flaws in others, and difficult to see one's own.
One exposes the flaws of others, yet hides one's own.

There is no path through the air,
There is no monk outside the path.
There is no refuge outside the Dharma.
There are no permanent things.

People love their obstacles, only enlightened ones transcend them."

"Bear harsh words, know that most people behave poorly.
A person that has tamed themselves and bears harsh words, is among the best of men.

One who is gluttonous is reborn a simpleton, again and again, continuously suffering.

My mind once wandered restlessly, wherever it chose, but now I hold it in check.

Be vigilant, protect your mind; free yourself from difficulty.

If one cannot find a companion that is wise and upright, walk alone, like a king leaving a conquered land, or an elephant wandering the forest.

It is better to live alone, than to have a fool for a companion.
Live alone, avoid evil, be harmless and at ease, like an elephant in the forest.

It is pleasant to have friends when you need them, to be satisfied with whatever comes your way, to know virtue at the moment of death, to be beyond all suffering.

It is pleasant to be a loving child, to show respect others, to reach old age, to be of unshakeable faith, to achieve insight, and abstain from evil."

"It is good to restrain the senses, the body, and the mind.
One with restrain and moderation is free from suffering.
One who delights in insight, development, and calm, who lives alone and is content, they may be called "Bhikkhu".

How pleasant is the discourse of the monk, spare in words, who talks with wisdom, who is simple and clear in expressing the Dharma.

One should not despise their own blessings, nor covet what others have.

One who is not attached their mind or body, who does not mourn loss and decay, they may be called "Bhikku".

One who lives in loving kindness, devoted to the teachings, will realize Nirvana. 

Empty this boat, and it will move lightly.
Cut off desire and ill-will, and you will reach Nirvana.

Cut off self-delusion, doubt, attachment to beliefs, sensuality, and desires;
Cut off pride, restlesslessness, ignorance, and desire for power;
Cultivate confidence, mindfulness, effort, concentration, and insight;
Trascend passion, anger, ignorance, pride, and delusion.

Meditate, and do not be negligent.
Do not allow your heart to be lost in the pleasures of the senses.

Without reason there is no concentration, without concentration there is no reason.
Whoever has both, approaches Nirvana.

One who enters a bare room with a serene mind, contemplating the nature of all things, will experience trascendence.

Whenever one contemplates existence, they become filled with joy and happiness, deathlessness.
Control the senses. Practice equanimity.
Live by discipline. Associate with good friends.
Be courteous, and well mannered.
Put an end to suffering.

Just as a flower is shed when the time comes,
you must shed desire and hatred.

One who is peaceful, who is composed, who cannot be tempted, can be called peaceful.

Each person is their own refuge, their own shelter;
Therefore, each person should improve themselves."

"When all the world recognizes beauty as beauty, this in itself is ugliness; when all the world recognizes good as good, this in itself is evil. 

Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth to each other;
Difficult and easy compliment each other;
Long and short exhibit each other;
High and low set measure to each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Back and front follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage manages their affairs without ado, and spreads their teaching without talking. They deny nothing, lay claim to nothing, do work without taking pride, accomplishes tasks without dwelling upon them.

And yet, it is just becaue they do not dwell upon it, that no one can take it away from them."

"Heaven and Earth are not sentimental, treating all things the same.
The sage is not sentimental, treating all things the same.

Between Heaven and Earth, there seems to be a bellows; it is empty, and yet inexhaustible; the more it works, the more comes out of it; no amount of words can fathom it - better look for it within."

"Only simple and quiet words will ripen of themselves.
A whirlwind does not last a whole morning, nor does a shower last a whole day. Who is their author? Heaven and Earth!
Even Heaven and Earth cannot make such violent things last long; how much more true is it of the rash endeavours of humanity?

Hence, they who cultivate the Tao are one with the Tao;
They who practice Virtue are one with Virtue;
They who court after Loss is one with Loss.

Deficiency of faith on your part entails faithlessness on the part of others."

"They who know humankind are clever;
They who know themselves have insight.
They who conquer human beings have force;
They who conquer themselves are truly strong.

They who know when they have enough is rich;
They who adhere assiduously to the path of Tao are people of steady purpose.
They who stay where they have found their true home endure long, they who die but perish not enjoy true longevity."

"What is well planted cannot be uprooted, what is well embraced cannot slip away; your descendants will carry on the ancestral rites for generations without end.

Cultivate Virtue, and it becomes a genuine part of you.
Cultivate it in the family, and it will abide.
Cultivate it in the community, and it will live and grow.
Cultivate it in the state, and it will flourish abundantly.
Cultivate it in the world, and it will become universal.

Hence, a person must be judged as a person, a family as a family, a community as a community, a state as a state, the world as the world

How do I know about the world? By what is within me."





Some are born to good parents, others to cruel parents;
Some are born into well-off families, others into poverty.


What is truth in one church is heresy in another;
What is correct in one teaching is incorrect in another;




how we grow and react to life's challenges defines who we are

'The circumstances of our birth and situations we find ourselves in are irrelevant; how we react and grow is what defines us, even after we are gone.' - mewtwo


/	/	/	/	/


open heart, open mind

we transform through adversity and love

we all have hidden potential, have faith!


you are always going through deaths and rebirths; honor both, at every moment

the blossom vanishes as the fruit grows

each stage and label falls away in time

each person's journey is unique 

sadhana will only become more difficult with progress - 'there are lions at every inner gate' - keep going!

at first, sadhana is an effort; at a certain point, it becomes like breathing.

you are being guided; trust in your heart , intuition, and the universe

this journey is an inner journey

Where do we begin? Wherever we are!

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

you cannot force a flower to bloom, or a snake to shed its skin.

one cannot change their nature; it is best to use what makes you unique to the benefit of yourself and others

never pity or damn yourself;
redefine things from a perspective of absolute compassion

your relationships will either improve as you grow, which is fortunate, or they will 'get you' less, and tune out, which in the long run, is also fortunate

a tree must be protected when it is young, so it may shelter others when it grows tall

what is important is keeping yourself in order

whatever stage you are in, accept it fully - only when you have surrendered fully do you go to the next level

what keeps you from inner fulfillment? 
posturing, thoughts, beliefs, plans, ggames, exploring, new experiences... 

caterpillar, cocoon, metamorphosis, butterfly; an inevitable process that cannot be rushed

an unfolding process under which you have no control


tapasya, straightening by fire

we wake up at the rate we wake up
part of being born is growing!

there will always be another step to take

life is a gradual process of liberation


We are uniquely gifted to shape our lives to our highest calling.

Use your gifts to share your truth, your light, what gives you joy - and in doing so, inspire others.

Express yourself in meaningful ways.

Rediscover yourself; become aware of your true potential.

You rise as high as your greatest aspiration, you sink as low as your most negative conception of yourself.

Life can be so much more, if we let it be.

We are unaware of our true potential, and the true nature of reality.

Belive in the impossible.

Prioritize your own happiness over others' expectations.

Never doubt or censor yourself; Never compromise when it comes to yourself.

Recognize and break the cycles of familial, generational, and ancestral trauma placed upon you.

Our emotions become constructive only when we use them to create, to connect with ourselves and others.

If you wish for collective progress, focus on personal growth and development. 
"Let each restore their own clarity, then nature and all the world will be restored."

Only when we have reclaimed our sovereignty and power as individuals, can we come together and change our world.

Our potential is limitless; we have the power to create and manifest all that we imagine and desire, to shape our lives to our highest calling.


Heal and inspire yourself, and you can do the same for others.

Let one mold themselves in accordance with the precepts they teach.

Only self shelters self. What shelter is there outside the self?

One should not neglect themselves for the sake of another.
One must learn first before teaching.
Let each person embrace their own truth, and devote themselves to its fulfillment."

Threatened with danger, many go to gardens, sacred mountains and forests. But these places are not the Supreme Refuge.
Take refuge in the teachings of the enlightened ones, within one's self."

To set limits on yourself, or what is possible, is not rational, only foolish.

Reading a book is meditation; planting a seed is alchemy.

Life is a journey, not a destination; embracing change and the cycles of life is the true path to enlightenment.

Make the most of this journey; explore the depths of your own soul.

Accept that the journey is never-ending, that life and death, Earth and Heaven, will take you to many unexpected places.

A tree as big as one's embrace springs from a tiny seed;
A tower nine stories high begins as a heap of earth and stone;
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

live your truth


fear no failure, desire no success; fix thy gaze upon the star whose ray thou art, the flaming star that shines within the depths of eternity


'to everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven' - ecclesiastes

'not even the greatest masters can go a single step for their disciples; in themselves, they must experience each stage of developing consciousness. they will know nothing for which they are not ready' - de Lubicz


'One may conquer a million men in battle,
'It is easy to see the flaws in others, and difficult to see one's own.
One exposes the flaws of others, yet hides one's own.'
'People love their obstacles, only enlightened ones transcend them."
Therefore, each person should improve themselves.
The wise one, by self-mastery, creates an island no flood can submerge.
The mindful person among the mindless,
the aware among the unaware,
surpasses the rest without being noticed.
A seeker, concentrating on mindfulness, advances like fire, consuming the chains of their own bondage."




'a person interested in science should be disappointed in science, a person interested in religion should be disappointed in religion, a person interested in philosophy should be disappointed in philosophy, and so on.' - gurdjieff

'We are born into the world of nature, our second birth is into the world of Spirit' - Bhagavad Gita

Pay no attention to what is said or done by others, pay close attention to your own actions and inactions.

any time someone expresses doubt or cynicism, it can only resonate in you as far as you doubt yourself.

Release all self-centered beliefs and behaviors, let go of all that burdens you, and holds you back;
Free yourself from limiting and restrictive beliefs.


I gave up, then I was ready for the next message; there is always another message

'Far within me, where the memory of what I am is still unclouded, a little child is waking up and making an old man's mask weep.
A little child looking for their parents, looking for protection and help, from their own dreams, to become what they are without imitating anyone'...Daumal


The Vedanta recognizes no sin it only recognizes error. And the greatest error, says the Vedanta is to say that you are weak, that you are a sinner, a miserable creature, and that you have no power and you cannot do this and that.
Never think there is anything impossible for the soul. It is the greatest heresy to think so. If there is sin, this is the only sin — to say that you are weak, or others are weak.


If you want to have life, you have to die every moment for it. Life and death are only different expressions of the same thing looked at from different standpoints; they are the falling and the rising of the same wave, and the two form one whole.

This I have seen in life — those who are overcautious about themselves fall into dangers at every step; those who are afraid of losing honor and respect, get only disgrace; and those who are always afraid of loss, always lose.
- Swami Vivekenanda

The transformation of the world is brought about by the transformation of oneself.
- Jiddu Krishnamurti

This is the first lesson to learn: be determined not to curse anything outside, not to lay the blame upon anyone outside, but stand up, lay the blame on yourself. You will find that is always true. Get hold of yourself.


Every ending is a new beginning;
Life is an endless unfoldment;
Inspire yourself;
Your life is yours...
