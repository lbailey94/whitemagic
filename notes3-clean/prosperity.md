# Prosperity

PROSPERITY 

Life is a journey, not a destination; embracing change and the cycles of life is the true path to enlightenment.

Make the most of this journey; explore the depths of your own soul.

Carry your light; let it shine.

Spread love and inspiration; create a brighter future for all beings

If one is lucky to live a hundred years, that is 1200 months, 36,000 days, 600,000 hours. Why waste any time at all, knowing it is limited, and running out?

Find joy, peace, and understanding - then help others.

We have ego so that we can experience and understand ourselves, others, and the world around us; to appreciate Creation and the Creator.

Every living thing has a purpose and a meaning, a reason for being here.

Enjoy life, grow, and help others along the way

We are meant to co-create reality, to help and care for all life, to contribute to the complexity of an infinite and ever-changing universe.

Life is  Flower; there is a seed that comes before, and a fruit with many seeds that comes after.

Love and wisdom are blooming lotus, rising through darkness, into the light.

Love, Teach, and Help One Another.

Every discovery leads us closer to ourselves, each other, and the Creator.

Humankind was created to give companionship to the Creator, and to care for the world and all living things.

We are here to appreciate and shape existence.

Existence is Joy, Suffering a waning shadow;
And what is left after its passing is strength, wisdom, and self-mastery.

The truths of life cannot be communicated, only experienced.

Accept that the journey is never-ending, that life and death, Earth and Heaven, will take you to many unexpected places.

The key to finding peace, joy, and fulfillment, is to look inside yourself, and share your gifts with others.

Live without fear, regret, or hesitation

Do all things with sincerity, and with an open heart.

Live for the benefit of all beings.

Be good to one another; live your lives in love and service.

If one wishes to enjoy the greatest gifts of life, and share them with others, the path lays in joy, peace, love, and understanding.

Plant seeds in the hearts of others.

Live quietly, peacefully, growing in wisdom and experience, abiding and waiting patiently for opportunities to arise.

All illness stems from external forces acting on internal conditions, creating weakness.

The body can heal itself; all a healer has to do is start the process

People can heal themselves, if told to so under hypnosis






























Good people are the teachers of bad people;
Bad people are the responsibility of good people.

Not to revere one's teacher, not to cherish one's charge, is to be on the wrong path, however skilled or intelligent one may be.

This is an essential tenet of the Tao."

"A Sage has no interests of their own, but takes on the interests of the people.

They are kind to the kind, and to the unkind as well, for Virtue is kind.

They are faithful to the faithful, and to the unfaithful, for Virtue is faithful.

"You govern a kingdom with normal rules;
You win a war through exceptional moves;
But you win the world by leaving it alone.
How do I know? By what is within me!

The more taboos and inhibitions there are in the world, the poorer the people become;
The more powerful the weapons become, the greater confusion reigns in the realm;
The more clever and cunning people become, the more often strange things happen;
The more laws and ordinances are passes, the more criminals and thieves arise.

Therefore, a Sage makes no fuss, and people transform themselves;
They love silence, and people settle into their regular ways.
They engage in nothing, and people accumulate wealth.
They have no desires, and people return to simplicity."

"Where the ruler is silent, the people are simple and happy.
Where the ruler is cunning, the people are wily and discontent.

Bad fortune is what good fortune leans on,
Good fortune is what bad fortune hides in.

Who knows the end of the process?
Is there no norm or right way?

What is normal soon becomes abnormal;
What is auspicious soons turn ominous.

Long indeed have the people been lost.

Therefore, a Sage squares without cutting away, carves without disfiguring, straightens without effort, enlightens without dazzling."

"In governing the people and in serving Heaven, there is nothing like frugality;
To be frugal is to return before straying.

To return before straying is to have double Virtue;
To have double Virtue is to overcome everything;
To overcome everything is to reach an invisible height;
Only one who has reached such a height should hold a kingdom.

Only one who has seen the Divine Mother can last long;
This is the way to be deep rooted, planted firmly in the Tao, the secret to long life and lasting vision."

"Ruling a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish.

When a man of Tao reigns over the world, demons have no power, for spirits wish no ill upon humankind.

If only the rulers and people refrained from harming one another, all the benefits of life would accumulate within the kingdom."

"Do nothing, strive to become effortless, savor the savorless; exalt the low, multiply the few, requite injury with kindness.

Nip troubles in the bud; sow the great within the small.

We have all the resources and technology we need, what we lack is compassion.

We must create a new civilization, centered around creating a better future, the restoration and protection of nature, rights and freedoms, and the cultivation of peace and understanding.

Our collective problems are a result of our collective action, and inaction. In order to free ourselves, we must all decide, of our own free will, to live in lasting peace and harmony.

One should dwell and act in the village, as a bee taking pollen from a flower, and leaving the color and fragrance intact.

"Perhaps the Way of Heaven may be likened to the stretching of a bow: the upper part lowers, while the lower part rises.
If the string is too long, it is cut - if it is too short, it is added onto.

The Way of Heaven takes from what is excessive to supply what is deficient.

The Way of Man is to take from the deficient to supply the excessive.

Only one who lives in the Tao can use their riches to benefit the world.

Therefore, a Sage does work without claiming it, accomplishes tasks without dwelling upon them, and does not want their merit o be noticed."

"Ah, a small country with few people!
Though there are highly efficient machines, people have no use for them.

Let them mind death, and refrain from travel to distant places.

Though there be weapons and armor, there are no occasions to use or display them.

Let people revert to communication  through knotted cords.

See to it that they are content with their food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with their houses, and inured to a simple life.

Though there may be another country so close that they are within sight of each other, there is little traffic between them, and the two peoples have nothing to do with one another."

All that you put into the world will return to you tenfold - be kind, and careful of how you treat yourself, others, and nature.


There is no one way of life that is right for all people, no one way that is right for all situations. Our strength lays in our diversity, our unique experiences and perspectives.

Social progress and change does not lay in the hands of the powerful few, but in the hands of the people.

What do happiness and freedom mean, when our family suffers, and lives under oppression, and in captivity?

In a society founded upon and sustained by greed and corruption, everything is cheapened, and made for sale.
How do we live a meaningful and honest life, in a civilization that is fundamentally meaningless and dishonest?

We must not define ourselves and others by our circumstances, or our capabilities, but by our character, our acts, and our shared journey towards joy and peace.

We have been trapped in a cycle for over ten thousand years, and though it has given us great knowledge and power, it has not been tempered with compassion and wisdom, and has cost us greatly.


Unless we learn to live in harmony, within the Circle, we cannot escape from cycles of conflict and disaster.

People should seek their own ability, and give freely of themselves

all sides should address each others' concerns through compassionate discussion

a conscious being does not see givers and recievers, only hungry people, food, and effort required.
Identity has nothing to do with it -
Our Hunger, Our Food, Our Effort.
Does your left hand thank the right?

"Can there be joy and laughter when always the world is ablaze?
Enshrouded in darkness, should one not seek a light?

And as we are — the world is. That is, if we are greedy, envious, competitive, our society will be competitive, envious, greedy, which brings misery and war. The State is what we are. To bring about order and peace, we must begin with ourselves and not with society, not with the State, for the world is ourselves … If we would bring about a sane and happy society we must begin with ourselves and not with another, not outside of ourselves, but with ourselves.

The problem that confronts most of us is whether the individual is merely the instrument of society or the end of society. Are you and I as individuals to be used, directed, educated, controlled, shaped to a certain pattern by society and government; or does society, the State, exist for the individual? Is the individual the end of society; or is he merely a puppet to be taught, exploited, butchered as an instrument of war? That is the problem that is confronting most of us. That is the problem of the world; whether the individual is a mere instrument of society, a plaything of influences to be moulded; or whether society exists for the individual.

As human beings living in this monstrously ugly world, let us ask ourselves, can this society, based on competition, brutality and fear, come to an end? Not as an intellectual conception, not as a hope, but as an actual fact, so that the mind is made fresh, new and innocent and can bring about a different world altogether? It can only happen, I think, if each one of us recognises the central fact that we, as individuals, as human beings, in whatever part of the world we happen to live or whatever culture we happen to belong to, are totally responsible for the whole state of the world.

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs

Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Ooh, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book


But we're gonna rise and shine!
And win our liberation,
For now is the time
When all nations must be free.
So rise and shine!
Restore your strength and power,
Waste no more time,
Remember your history.

But we're gonna rise!
As the morning sun that surrounds you,
It's international morality time,
Where mankind must be born anew.
For the sake of the younger generations,
Putting hearts and minds,
To brotherhood and unity.


If you are living in a market place
And you're no buyer or seller.
You'll find yourself left in space
Subject to be bought or sold.
If you are living in a tenant yard
And you are not the land owner.
You'll get a notice from your landlord
To leave sooner or later.
So what you need is liberation.
Everyone need it. Liberation.
The young and old they need liberation.
Let's come together for the liberation.
If you are in bondage. Liberation.
If you are not free you need liberation.
Lets unite for the liberation.
If you are dwelling on a piece of land
And are not the land owner.
You can be sure that the government man
Is gonna label you a squatter.
If you are an alien in a far country
And you are treated as a stranger.
You don't belong to that society
You could a end up in danger.
If you are caught between church and state
And you are feeling the pressure.
You got to get out before it's too late
Or you got to work without pleasure.
And if you borrow and you can't pay
Don't bother sit there and wonder.
Your revenue and budget could be taken away
And you belly could a end up with hunger.
If you are working on a plantation
And you are not the boss-man.
Don't ever rest from being tired
Or you could get fired.
If you don't belong to one party
And you belong to another.
You are subversive to unity
And no man is your brother.


The rise in prices is rising every time
And unemployment is making people turn to crime
A bare promises and a bagga tricks
While you kill each other over politics
You want unity inna you community
Though you don't belong to high society
We hear of problems over the media
About the black man's struggle inna Africa

If I had to fight for emancipation
Then I shall resist for my liberation
And with truth and right I shall win my liberty
We shall unite to secure the victory
Cudjoe and Nanny, their courage and their bravery
Cuffy and Quashy, delivered their race from slavery
Marcus Garvey and His Imperial Majesty
Luther King and Marley, voices the oppression of humanity


(Jah Jah time has come)
Give us freedom of reality
We don't want no partiality
Give us unity, not vanity, tell you

And don't you be the one, to be caught red handed,
Don't you be the one, who is offended.

(..)

We've got to win, yes, it's not a physical thing,
But it's the fight, oh it's the fight that goes on so deep within, yes.
