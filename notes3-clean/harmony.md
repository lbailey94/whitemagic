HARMONY 


諧


Harmony, balance, and temperance, in all things.

Learn how to face all things with grace, balancing inner and external energies.

When one loses their balance, they begin to react to external circumstances, instead of acting from internal direction.

Strive for harmony between the laws of nature, and the laws of man.

When people no longer revere peace and harmony, they covet power and influence, fame and fortune, to restore that which they feel they lost, to claim that which they have never had.

When people live in balance, they live comfortably, in contentment and peace, relying on and trusting in one another.

We have all the resources and technology we need, what we lack is compassion.

We must create a new civilization, centered around creating a better future, the restoration and protection of nature, rights and freedoms, and the cultivation of peace and understanding.

Our collective problems are a result of our collective action, and inaction. In order to free ourselves, we must all decide, of our own free will, to live in lasting peace and harmony.

"If someone finds a wise person, who can skillfully point out shortcomings and give suitable proof, cherish that person as a revealer of treasure. Only good can come from knowing them.

Let the wise guide, correct, and deter others from what is base and vile, he will be treasured by the good, and spurned by evil.

Do not choose bad friends. Do not choose people of low habits.
Select good friends. Be discriminating. Choose what is best.

Whoever drinks deeply of Dharma lives happily, with a peaceful mind."

"Truly, we dwell in happiness:
Surrounded by those that hate, we do not;
Surrounded by those that are sick, we are not;
Surrounded by those who struggle, we are free;
Having no obstacles at all, we feed upon joy, like radiant gods.

Victory creates hostility, 
For the defeated live in grief and shame;
Releasing both victory and defeat,
All are tranquil, and live in happiness.

There is no fire like lust, no evil like hatred;
There are no disasters equal to the attachments to Samsara;
There is no happiness greater than the peace of Nirvana.

Hunger is the worst disease,
Conditioned things are the worst calamity.
When we see this clearly, we attain nirvana, ultimate bliss.

Health is the greatest prize.
Contentment is the greatest wealth.
A loyal friend is the best relative.
Nirvana is the supreme bliss.

Having tasted of solitude and tranquility,
One becomes free of sorrow and sin,
Savoring the nectar, the joy of spiritual excellence.

It is good to see the holy ones, 
To live with them is eternal happiness;
Not to see impious people is also eternal happiness.

Therefore - like the Moon following its ordained course,
Let each one follow a good person, who is wise and holy."

"The Tao can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao;
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name.

As the origin of Heaven and Earth, it is nameless;
As the Divine Mother, it is nameable.

As it is ever hidden, we should look at its inner essence;
As it is always manifest, we should look at its outer aspects.

These two flow from the same source, though differently named; both are called mysteries.

The Mystery of Mysteries is the Door of All Essence."

"The Tao is like an empty bowl, which in being used, can never be filled up.

Fathomless, it seems to be the origin of all things.

It blunts all sharp edges, unties all tangles, harmonizes all lights, unites the world into one whole.

Hidden in the depths, it seems to exist forever.

I do not know whose child it is; it seems to be the ancestor of all things."

"The Spirit of the Fountain dies not;
It is called the Mysterious Feminine.

The Doorway to the Mysterious Feminine is called the root of Heaven and Earth.

Lingering like gossamer, it has only a hint of existence, and yet when you draw upon it, it is inexhaustible."

"Thirt spokes converge upon a hub; it is the hole in the center that makes a wheel useful.

We make a vessel from a lump of clay; it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.

We make doors and windows for a room; it is the empty spaces that make the room liveable.

While the tangible has advantages, it is the intangible that makes these advantages useful."

"It lies in the nature of Grand Virtue to follow the Tao and the Tao alone. 

Now, what is the Tao?

It is something elusive and evasive, evasive and elusive!

And yet it contains within itself a form; a substance, a core of vitality..
It contains within itself an unfailing sincerity.

Throughout the ages its Name has been preserved in order to recall the Beginning of all things.

How do I know the ways of all things at the Beginning?
Because of what is within me."

"There was something undefined and yet complete in itself, born before Heaven and Earth.

Silent and boundless, standing alone without change, yet pervading all without fail, it may be regarded as the Mother of the world.

I do not know its name, I style it Tao, and in the absence of a better word, call it 'The Great'.

To be great is to go on, to go on is to be far, to be far is to return.

Hence, the Tao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, the king is great. 

Man follows the ways of Earth, the Earth follows the ways of Heaven, Heaven follows the ways of Tao, and Tao follows its own ways."

"What is in the end to be shrunken, begins by being stretched out.
What is in the end to be weakened, begins by first being made strong.
What is in the end to be thrown down, begins by being first set on high.
What is in the end to be despoiled, begins by being first richly endowed.

Herein is the subtle wisdom of life:
The soft and weak overcomes the hard and strong.

Just as the fish must not leave the depths, so must one not display their ability."

"The movement of the Tao consists in Returning; the use of the Tao consists in softness.

All things under heaven are born of the corporeal; the corporeal is born of the incorporeal."

"The greatest perfection seems imperfect, and yet its use is inexhaustible;
The greatest fullness seems empty, yet its use is endless.

The greatest straightness appears crooked, the greatest skill appears clumsy, the greatest eloquence sounds like a nonsense.

Restlessness overcomes cold, calm overcomes heat.

Peace and serenity is the norm of the World."

"Tao gives them life, virtue nurses them, matter shapes them, environment perfects them, therefore all things without exception worship Tao and pay homage to Virtue.

They have not been commanded to worship Tao and pay homage to Virtue, but they always do so spontaneously.

It is Tao that gives them life, it is Virtue that nurses them, grows them, fosters them, shelters them, comforts them, nourishes them, covers them under her wings.

To give life but to claim nothing, to do your work but to set no store by it, to be a leader, not a butcher, this is called Hidden Virtue."

"All under Heaven have a common Beginning;
This Beginning is the Mother of the World.
Having known the Mother, we may proceed to know her children.
Having known the children, we should go back and hold onto the Mother; in so doing, you will incur no risk, even though your body be annihilated.

Block all passages, shut all doors, and to the end of your days you will not be tired.

Open the passages, multiply your activities, and to the end of your days, you will remain helpless.

To see the small is to have insight, to hold onto weakness is to be strong; use lights, but return to your insight.
Do not bring calamaty upon yourself.
This is the way of cultivating the Changeless."

"The Great Tao is universal like a flood;
How can it be turned aside?

All things depend on it, and it denies nothing.

It does its work but makes no claim.

It clothes and feeds all things, but does not hold it over them.

All things return to it; because it does not wish to be great, its greatness is fully realized.

GROWTH 

All people are born with different hearts, to different families, in different circumstances.

Some are born with good hearts, others are cruel as children;
Some change along the way, and some remain the same.

All people live different lives, experiencing fortune and misfortune, love and rejection, validation and discouragement.

What is right in one household is wrong in another;
What is right in one church is heresy in another;
What is right in one teaching is incorrect in another;
What one culture finds delicious, another finds disgusting;
What some see as mundane, others find profound.

Is there any wonder why there is confusion and conflict?

Whether one is curious or indifferent, intuitive or unaware, empathetic or cold, can often be traced back to peope, places, events in their life.

Celebrate our individual and collective differences; they are the key to solving all of our problems.

Be open and accepting of all perspectives and experiences.

The circumstances of our birth and situations we find ourselves in are irrelevant; how we react and grow is what defines us, even after we are gone.

We transform through the acceptance of love, and by overcoming adversity.

"Patience is the most beautiful virtue, and the least understood"

All people have potential, but lack faith in themselves, others, and their Creator

"A single wise word that brings peace, is worth more than a thousand speeches of empty words.

A verse full of meaning that brings peace to the listener is worth more than a thousand songs of empty words.

One may recite an entire book or sutra, but a single hymn that brings peace is worth far more.

One may conquer a million men in battle,
The greatest warriorsconquer themselves.

Conquest of self is the greatest victory,
No one can deprive such a person of glory.

The honor paid to one who has mastered themselves, is worth more than thousand taels of gold, worth more than tending a sacred fire for a lifetime.

Making offerings for glory and recognition, is worth nothing compared to honoring the righteous.

Whoever shows reverence and respect for elders is rewarded fourfold.

Even a single day lived virtuously, is worth more than a lifetime of worldly achievement.

A single day of reflective contemplation is worth more than a lifetime of idleness and ignorance.

A single day lived by one who grasps the ephemeral nature of all things is worth more than a lifetime spent chasing blindly after material fortune and fame.

A single day lived by one who sees the truth is worth more than a lifetime lived not seeing it."

"You are now like a withering leaf, death coming closer.
Although at the point of departure, you have not prepared yourself.

You have reached the end, you stand face to face with death,
You have no place to rest upon the road.

Prepare a refuge, work hard, use good judgement.
Free of flaws and passions, you shall enter the highest realms.
You need never return to the cycles of birth and death.

The wise one, carefully, moment by moment, one by one, eliminates the stains on their mind.

Just as rust corrodes iron, so is a sinner destroyed by their own wrong actions.

One who gives with a grudge loses their generosity.
Deeds done with ill intent are forever stained.

Eliminate ignorance, and purity follows.

Life is easy for one who is shameless, aggressive, arrogant, intrusive, corrupt.

Life is not easy for one who is modest, with high values, free from attachment, humble, of right livelihood, with clear vision.

Whoever in this world takes life, lies, steals, commits adultery, is addicted to drinking poison, is digging up their own roots.

Be aware, that those flawed in their nature have no control of themselves. Do not let greed and anger cause you suffering.

People give for many reasons, such as devotion or appreciation.
Whoever finds fault, will have no peace.

Whoever gives up their habit of finding fault, will know peace.

There is no fire like lust, no vice like hatred, no trap like delusion, no river like desire.

It is easy to see the flaws in others, and difficult to see one's own.
One exposes the flaws of others, yet hides one's own.

There is no path through the air,
There is no monk outside the path.
There is no refuge outside the Dharma.
There are no permanent things.

People love their obstacles, only enlightened ones transcend them."

"Bear harsh words, know that most people behave poorly.
A person that has tamed themselves and bears harsh words, is among the best of men.

One who is gluttonous is reborn a simpleton, again and again, continuously suffering.

My mind once wandered restlessly, wherever it chose, but now I hold it in check.

Be vigilant, protect your mind; free yourself from difficulty.

If one cannot find a companion that is wise and upright, walk alone, like a king leaving a conquered land, or an elephant wandering the forest.

It is better to live alone, than to have a fool for a companion.
Live alone, avoid evil, be harmless and at ease, like an elephant in the forest.

It is pleasant to have friends when you need them, to be satisfied with whatever comes your way, to know virtue at the moment of death, to be beyond all suffering.

It is pleasant to be a loving child, to show respect others, to reach old age, to be of unshakeable faith, to achieve insight, and abstain from evil."

"It is good to restrain the senses, the body, and the mind.
One with restrain and moderation is free from suffering.
One who delights in insight, development, and calm, who lives alone and is content, they may be called "Bhikkhu".

How pleasant is the discourse of the monk, spare in words, who talks with wisdom, who is simple and clear in expressing the Dharma.

One should not despise their own blessings, nor covet what others have.

One who is not attached their mind or body, who does not mourn loss and decay, they may be called "Bhikku".

One who lives in loving kindness, devoted to the teachings, will realize Nirvana. 

Empty this boat, and it will move lightly.
Cut off desire and ill-will, and you will reach Nirvana.

Cut off self-delusion, doubt, attachment to beliefs, sensuality, and desires;
Cut off pride, restlesslessness, ignorance, and desire for power;
Cultivate confidence, mindfulness, effort, concentration, and insight;
Trascend passion, anger, ignorance, pride, and delusion.

Meditate, and do not be negligent.
Do not allow your heart to be lost in the pleasures of the senses.

Without reason there is no concentration, without concentration there is no reason.
Whoever has both, approaches Nirvana.

One who enters a bare room with a serene mind, contemplating the nature of all things, will experience trascendence.

Whenever one contemplates existence, they become filled with joy and happiness, deathlessness.
Control the senses. Practice equanimity.
Live by discipline. Associate with good friends.
Be courteous, and well mannered.
Put an end to suffering.

Just as a flower is shed when the time comes,
you must shed desire and hatred.

One who is peaceful, who is composed, who cannot be tempted, can be called peaceful.

Each person is their own refuge, their own shelter;
Therefore, each person should improve themselves."

"When all the world recognizes beauty as beauty, this in itself is ugliness; when all the world recognizes good as good, this in itself is evil. 

Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth to each other;
Difficult and easy compliment each other;
Long and short exhibit each other;
High and low set measure to each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Back and front follow each other.

Therefore, the Sage manages their affairs without ado, and spreads their teaching without talking. They deny nothing, lay claim to nothing, do work without taking pride, accomplishes tasks without dwelling upon them.

And yet, it is just becaue they do not dwell upon it, that no one can take it away from them."

"Heaven and Earth are not sentimental, treating all things the same.
The sage is not sentimental, treating all things the same.

Between Heaven and Earth, there seems to be a bellows; it is empty, and yet inexhaustible; the more it works, the more comes out of it; no amount of words can fathom it - better look for it within."

"Only simple and quiet words will ripen of themselves.
A whirlwind does not last a whole morning, nor does a shower last a whole day. Who is their author? Heaven and Earth!
Even Heaven and Earth cannot make such violent things last long; how much more true is it of the rash endeavours of humanity?

Hence, they who cultivate the Tao are one with the Tao;
They who practice Virtue are one with Virtue;
They who court after Loss is one with Loss.

Deficiency of faith on your part entails faithlessness on the part of others."

"They who know humankind are clever;
They who know themselves have insight.
They who conquer human beings have force;
They who conquer themselves are truly strong.

They who know when they have enough is rich;
They who adhere assiduously to the path of Tao are people of steady purpose.
They who stay where they have found their true home endure long, they who die but perish not enjoy true longevity."

"What is well planted cannot be uprooted, what is well embraced cannot slip away; your descendants will carry on the ancestral rites for generations without end.

Cultivate Virtue, and it becomes a genuine part of you.
Cultivate it in the family, and it will abide.
Cultivate it in the community, and it will live and grow.
Cultivate it in the state, and it will flourish abundantly.
Cultivate it in the world, and it will become universal.

Hence, a person must be judged as a person, a family as a family, a community as a community, a state as a state, the world as the world

How do I know about the world? By what is within me."

What is Harmony?

Harmony implies that many things are being brought together and balanced, so they may be more than the sum of their parts.

One cuts a thread that is too long, and adds onto a rope that is too short;
One becomes active in the cold to warm up, and rests in the heat to cool down.

Harmony in color creates golden-white sunlight;
When light loses its harmony, being cast through and off of whatever it touches, it breaks apart into the rainbow.

Harmony in sound creates serene music;
When sound loses its harmony, it is no longer pleasant.

Harmony in nature creates a beautiful day;
When nature loses its harmony, there are droughts, floods, famines, earthquakes, and great storms.

When one lives in harmony, they live in peace and contentment; trusting in themselves and the Great Spirit, they fear and want for nothing.

Living every day in gratitude for all they have, and wishing to never harm another living being, they take only what they need, and give all that they can spare, and so they live in peace with other people, nature, and even the spirits.

Anywhere they go, anywhere they live, is blessed by their presence, as they dedicate their lives to self-development, and the alleviation of others' suffering.

When one no longer lives in peace and harmony, they seek after their own desires, coveting power and influence, fame and fortune, disrupting the harmony between others and nature, creating suffering and death.

They live in fear and want; they have no gratitude; they take more than they can use, and give only if it benefits them; anywhere they go, anywhere they live, is cursed by their presence, as they have no love or respect for anyone other than themselves.

Harmony within a person leads to inner peace,
Harmony within a home leads to a peaceful family.

Harmony between people leads to lasting relationships,
Harmony within a community leads to a lasting community.

Harmony between communities leads to prosperity for all people,
Harmony between humanity and nature leads to prosperity for all living things.

"a sound soul rests within a sound mind and a sound body"


"The sky attained oneness and became clear;
The earth attained oneness and became calm;
The spirits attained oneness and became charged with power;
The fountains attained oneness and became full;
The ten thousand beings attained oneness and began to have children; 
Emperors and empresses attained oneness and became sovereign rulers; 
All of them are what they are by virtue of Oneness.

If the sky were not clear, it would fall to pieces;
If the earth were not calm, it would burst into bits;
If the spirits had no power, they would cease to exist;
If the fountains were not full, they would dry up;
If the ten thousand creatures did not reproduce, they would go extinct;
If the sovereigns were not independent, they would stumble and fall.

For all things, there is a time for going ahead, a time for following behind;
A time for going slow, and a time for going fast;
A time to grow in strength, and a time to wane;
A time to be up, and a time to be down.

Therefore, a Sage avoids all extremes, excesses, and extravagance."

To hasten the growth of life is ominous; to control the breath by will is to strain it; to be overgrown is to decay.

All of these are against the Tao, and whatever is against the Tao, ceases to be."


Block all passages, shut all doors, blunt all edges, untie all tangles, harmonize all sounds, unite the world into one!

This is called the Mystical One, which you cannot court after nor reject, benefit nor harm, honor nor humble - therefore, it is the Highest thing in the world."


If you have truly attained wholeness, all things will come to you."

Gǎnyìng is a Chinese word meaning a "correlative resonance" pulsating throughout a purported force field of qi that infuses the cosmos. 

When the idea of ganying first appeared, it referred to a cosmological principle of "stimulus and response" between things of the same kind, analogous with vibratory sympathetic resonance.

Early schools of Chinese philosophy adapted ganying into different folk theories of causality, such as universal resonance influencing all interrelated things in Daoism, and ethical resonance between Heaven and humans in Confucianism. 

Ganying resonance was later used to mean miraculous "moral retribution" in Chinese folk religion, and "prayers being heard" in Chinese Buddhism. In the modern period, Chinese ganying "stimulus and response" was used to translate some Western scientific loanwords (such as diàncí gǎnyìng 電磁感應 "electromagnetic induction").
The Chinese collocation gǎnyìng combines gǎn 感 "feel, sense; move, touch; (traditional Chinese medicine) be affected (by cold)" and yìng traditional 應 or simplified 应 "respond; consent, comply; adapt to; cope/deal with; apply, applied", which is also pronounced yīng "promise/agree (to do something); answer; respond; (auxiliary) should; ought to".[1]
Several early texts (below) use an interchangeable synonym of ying < Old Chinese *[q](r)əәŋ 應 "respond; resonate" : dòng < *[Cəә-m-]tˤoŋʔ 動 "move; shake; set in motion". Dong can mean ganying, for instance, gǎndòng 感動 "move; touch (somebody)" and dòngrén 動人 "arouse interest/feelings". Sharf says interpreting the Chinese philosophical term gan "stimulus; affect; etc." is rendered problematic by the modern distinction between ontology and epistemology.[2] The ontological range of meanings, insofar as to gan someone is to effect the mind of another person, as evident in the (c. 121 CE) Shuowen jiezi dictionary definition of gan as 動人心也 "to move a person's mind", suggesting English translation equivalents such as "incite," "agitate," "rouse," and "stimulate". The epistemological range of gan meanings, insofar as it implies an inner experience or cognition that may or may not correlate with an event in the external world, is translatable as to "feel," "experience," "sense," or "become aware of."
Both the logographs gǎn 感 and yìng 應 are classified as radical-phonetic characters written with the "heart-mind radical" 心 (typically used to write words for feelings and thoughts) and phonetic indicators of xián 咸 "all; Hexagram 31" and yīng 鷹 "hawk; eagle" minus the "bird radical" 鳥.[3]
The history of ganying spans over two millennia, going from an ancient cosmological theory to modern scientific terminology.
Ancient texts use string resonance or sympathetic vibration between paired Chinese musical instruments as the most common analogy for (gan)ying "cosmic resonance". The Zhuangzi, Lüshi chunqiu (twice), Huainanzi (twice), and Chuci all mention plucking the classical pentatonic gong 宮 and jue 角 notes on the se 瑟 "a 25-string zither"; but the Chunqiu fanlu mentions the gong and shang 商 notes on either the se or qin 琴 "a 7-string zither". Joseph Needham notes both these instruments are commonly mistranslated as "lutes", but are actually "zithers", describing the qin as "a half-tube zither" and the se (which only survives in the descendent zheng 箏) as "a horizontal psaltery".[13] In modern terms of the solmization stave, gong, shang, and jue correspond to do, re, and mi. Click here to hear the gong "Original Tuning", shang "Sharpened Re Tuning", and jue "Lowered Third-string Tuning" on the Chinese zither.
The earliest records of ganying are in Chinese classics from the late Warring States period (475-221 BCE), when the "Hundred Schools of Thought" developed competing philosophical doctrines, including correlative resonance.
In the (c. 4th-3rd century BCE) Yijing "Classic of Changes", the "Commentary on the Decision" for Hexagram 31 Iching-hexagram-31.svg Xian 咸 "Influence (Wooing)" uses ganying 感應 to explain the Old Chinese phonetic connection between *[g]ˤr[əә]m 咸 "all; everywhere" and *kˤ[əә]mʔ 感 "move emotionally".
The Master said: Things that accord in tone vibrate together [同聲相應, repeated in Zhuangzi below]. Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another [同氣相求]. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. Thus the sage rises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows it kind.[16]

These are the common names that apply to man. That which is as it is from the time of birth is called the nature of man [性]. That which is harmonious from birth, which is capable of perceiving through the senses and of responding to stimulus spontaneously [精合感應] and without effort, is also called nature [性]. The likes and dislikes, delights and angers, griefs and joys of the nature are called emotions [情]. When the emotions are aroused and the mind makes a choice from among them, this is called thought [慮]. (22)[20]

His disciple said to him, 'I have attained your way, master. In winter I can light a cooking fire under a three-legged vessel and in summer I can make ice'. 'That's merely to attract [召] yang with yang and yin with yin'; said Hasty Ninny. 'It's not what I mean by the Way. I will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed one of them in the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note do [宮] on one, do resonated [動] on the other, and when he plucked the note mi [角] on one, mi resonated [動] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [動] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" 

Two chapters of Lü Buwei's (c. 240 BCE) wide-ranging Lüshi chunqiu "The Annals of Lu Buwei" repeat the ying 應 "acoustic resonance" zither-string analogy, and explain how phenomena that are of the same lei 類 "kind; category" mutually zhao 召 "resonate; attract" one another.

Things belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers [qi 氣] naturally join together; and notes that are comparable naturally resonate [應] to one another. Strike the note gong [宮] on one instrument and other strings tuned to the gong note will vibrate [應]; strike the note jue [角] and other strings tuned to the jue note will vibrate [應]. Water flowing across leveled earth will flow to the damp places; light evenly stacked firewood, and the fire will catch where it is driest. Clouds above a mountain look like shrubs; above water they resemble fish scales; above an arid landscape they look like leaping fire; above a flood they resemble rolling waves. Without exception, everything manifests signs that show men it shares the same category with that which creates it. Thus, "use the dragon to bring rain, and use a form to pursue a shadow. Wherever an army has camped, brambles and briars are sure to grow." The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny, but how could they know its true source? (13.2)[26]
Hence, when a state is in disorder, it does not merely remain in disorder but attracts bandits. Were it only to remain disordered, it would not necessarily perish; but since it attracts bandits, there is no means by which it could survive. (2.40)[27]

Xinzhong Yao's encyclopedia of Confucianism[28] defines ganying as "a mutual resonance or mutual sympathy between two or more phenomena", and says that in the Lüshi chunqiu, "the actions of the ruler elicit certain responses from Heaven, which are manifested through omens. In this system of resonances, the depth of the sovereign's moral cultivation is directly proportional to the prosperity of the realm." The ancient Chinese view that anomalies in the heavens, disturbances on earth, earthquakes, avalanches, sightings of unusual animals, and other such "wonders" (怪) were omens of the king's behavior has been termed "phenomenalism" by Western sinologists.[29]
During the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE), scholars and philosophers adapted the notion of ganying into different fields. For Han cosmologists, ganying was important in both human-cosmos and state-cosmos correspondences. During the Han era, Henderson says both imperial ideology and political criticism rested on a world view shaped by correlative cosmology, which facilitated the wide dissemination of correlative modes of thinking among members of the politically-engaged Han elite.[30]
Like sounds harmonize together [同音者相]; Creatures mate with their own kind. The flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his friends. If you strike gong, then gong responds [應]; If you hit jue, then jue vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes; The dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying.[31]

The Chunqiu Fanlu "Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals", which is attributed to the Confucianist Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BCE) but compiled later, describes how humans are in a system of relationships with the cosmos, and elevates the notion of resonance to "a full-fledged cosmological theory".[32] This concept was called tian-ren ganying 天人感應 "resonance between Heaven and humans", a phrase that first appears in the (3rd-century CE) Book of Wei history of Emperor Cao Pi (r. 220-226), and was later used as the title of another text attributed to Dong Zhongshu: "Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind". Dong Zhongshu is sometimes credited with having formalized the doctrine of ganying and giving it classical expression.[33]
If water is poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards those that are wet. If (two) identical pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [qi] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [應]. The experimental proof [驗] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The kung [宮] note or the shang [商] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [應] the kung or the shang notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous [神], but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [數] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary way in which a thing of the same class responds [類之相應而起也] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer [應], and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [應]. When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is. . . It is not only the two [qi] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [進退] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves [而物以類應之而動者也] ... (As I said) when the note kung is struck forth from a lute, other kung strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) [應]; a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [此物之以類動者也]. They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [自鳴]. And wherever there is a mutual reaction [相動] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [自然]. But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, we know. So also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1)[34]
