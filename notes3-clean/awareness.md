# Awareness

_____________________________

PERSPECTIVE & AWARENESS

"Were you excited when you woke up this morning?"

All that you experience, is either a drag, or a gradual process of liberation. 

Perception is Reality - where have we heard that before?

All emotions and reactions stem from our experiences, beliefs, and opinions - 
about ourselves, others, and the world we live in.

People become used to certain habits and ways of thinking, even to the point of resisting change, and reacting with fear and anger to ways of life and perspectives that are different from their own.

"If a pickpocket meets a saint, they only see their pockets...
If you wear shoes, the entire Earth is covered in leather..."
- Hari Dass Baba

For people that live life from a place of negativity and cynicism, every negative experience only confirms their views, and every positive experiences are minimized, rationalized, or hand-waved away.

Attempting to convince an atheist that God exists, or a pessimist (sorry, realist!) to be optimistic, is as difficult as showing a bored child all the things they could play with, as difficult as convincing a racist old man to travel to other countries, or telling a hurt and bitter woman to trust others again.

The other side of this coin is, that if you attempt to introduce negativity to a positive person, it doesn't really work. Positive experiences reinforce their belief, and negative experiences are minimized, rationalized, or hand-waved away...

To someone who believes in themselves, in others, in the world, in God, every waking moment is a sign, a reminder, 
a manifestation of a conscious or unconscious desire, an encouraging synchronicity.

Is there a meaning, a purpose, an order to the universe?
Or is it all just pointless, mechanistic chaos? 
Is it all coincidence, or are there no coincidences?

It's all up to you - either way, you're right. 
Your Perception is Reality!

"First, believe that there is meaning behind everything, that everything in the world is good, is holy and beautiful. 
If you see something evil, you are not understanding it in the right light. Throw the burden on yourselves!"
- Swami Vivekenanda

"Change your mind, and you change your relation to time.." 
- Funkadelic

If you're not happy with the way things are, then obviously things have to change, and in order to change our lives, we must begin to look at everything, especially ourselves, in a different light. 

When we change our perceptions and beliefs of what is possible, what we are capable of, what our potential could be, we elevate and expand the horizons of our own consciousness - and if we're lucky, we do the same for others.

Would you tell your younger siblings, your nieces and nephews, your children, that they are limited in what they can do, what they can be? Would you tell them that the world around them is on a fixed path, that nothing can change?

Would you tell them to be 'Realistic', whatever that means - or will you tell them the truth - that if they express themselves, honestly and without hesitation, that they can change Reality itself through effort and will?

Now... what do you tell yourself every day?

If you want to liberate yourself, you have to look within - there is nothing outside of you that will save you.

There is no person, no place, no thing - no book, no drug, no method or teaching - that will lead you to lasting peace and happiness, unless it inspires you to go within.

BECOME CALM, PRESENT, CENTERED, HONEST, OPEN, AND AUTHENTIC.
LET GO OF THE PAST, OF THE FUTURE, AND EMBRACE EVERY MOMENT.

Tilopa's Six Words of Advice:

Let go of what has passed, 
Let go of what may come, 
Let go of what is happening now.
Don't try to figure anything out, 
Don't try to make anything happen, 
Relax, right now, and rest!

Do not concern yourself with the past, the future, or even with the present moment.
All things change, and eventually resolve themselves.

Accept the consequences of your choices without regret, take responsibility for your actions, and let go of all expectations.

If you are fully present, you are capable of making the best possible decisions in the present, therefore creating a better future. 

One can only enjoy the state of flow - the mindless quality of total involvement - when the illusory self of the ego is quiet, and there is no thought about what is being done, what came before, or what will come after.

"Mindfulness is the path to immortality, negligence is the path to death.
The vigilant never die, while the negligent are dead already.
With this understanding, those who are wise rejoice in mindfulness."
- Dhammapada

"A zen student must learn to waste time conscientiously." 
- Roshi Suzuki

Bring mindfulness and intention into every aspect of your life.
Embrace each moment; live in blissful awareness and gratitude.

Try your best to live in a relaxed and effortless state. 
Embrace wu wei - act without acting, move without being moved, 
see without being seen, hear without being heard, know without being known.

Live every moment as if it's the First Time - because it is! 
Time is constantly changing the world and people around us. 

"You never step into the same river twice..."

"Don't think about the past. Don't think about the future. Just be here Now." 

"Though your body and mind go through their natural dances, doing what they are meant to do, your Awareness remains in the calm center of your heart, the Here and Now, where we all are, have been, and always will be."





THE IMPORTANCE OF MEDITATION

"Meditate, and do not be negligent.
Do not allow your heart to be lost in the pleasures of the senses.
Without reason there is no concentration, without concentration there is no reason. 
Whoever has both, approaches Nirvana.
One who enters a bare room with a serene mind, contemplating the nature of all things, 
will experience trascendence." 

Emptying the mind is more important than the means of doing so.

Working on something you enjoy,  meditation, spending time with friends, sincere prayer, making love, song, dance, play... all are equally valid. 

So long as your Mind is free, focusing only on the present moment, and nothing exists within the mind except clear awareness, gratitude, and joy, you're doing something right!

"There are no obstacles to liberation, aside from the thought that there are obstacles."

Samadhi literally means "putting together, joining, combining with, union, harmonious whole, trance".
One of the Noble Eightfold Paths is "Right Samadhi" - with enough practice, you can live in a state of pure awareness, with absolute control over your own mind.

Samadhi is of two kinds -

Samprajnata Samadhi, "with support of an object of meditation", such as a mantra, yantra, and other means of concentration and visualization, which allows one to focus their mind and still the stream of consciousness.

Asamprajnata Samadhi, "without support of an object of meditation", which is said to lead to knowledge of purusha, or consciousness itself - led to the Zen technique of Shikintaza - simply sitting, and letting the mind exhaust itself.

"The Mind is a lake that throws stones into itself."

Here's an exercise in Samprajnata Samadhi -

Imagine a lake...the surface is choppy, waves going in all directions, each one representative of thoughts, feelings,
and memories...all of them are rising and falling, moving in all directions. 
Occasionally, the wind may push them in a certain way, but never for very long.

Create a single thought, a mantra, a single wave, in the center of the lake.
And as your repeat the thought, it creates ripples, spreading out over the surface of the lake.
As you repeat this thought, the ripples become waves unto themselves, and as they grow larger, they swallow up any other waves they touch.

And now, for the most difficult part...
When there is nothing on the lake except the circular, rhythmic waves of that one thought, when there is nothing but the mantra...stop. Let your Mind become quiet; and as the lake becomes still, its surface like a mirror, simply observe without thought. 

"Thoughts and emotions are waves, watch them disappear back into the vast, calm ocean."

Here is an exercise in Asamprajnata Samadhi -

Simply sit, and let thoughts, feelings, and memories arise naturally in your mind. 
Appreciate the stream of consciousness, listening intently, without interrupting.

Pay attention to your Mind, without analysis or judgement, as these things will only add more thoughts on top of the ones you were already having! 

Watch where it wanders, study how it works, look at what impulsive and intrusive thoughts appear, and what happens to them when you accept them and let them pass, without giving them validation, or attempting to suppress or rationalize them.

At first, you will feel as though your Mind is like a waterfall, a hundred thoughts a minute.

Slowly, the waterfall becomes a raging river...and as it winds on, it slows and widens, until it reaches the calm, endless ocean.

In either technique, the most difficult and important part of the process is the very end, when the Mind is empty - because it can only stay empty for so long. For beginners, it may only last for a few moments at a time. 
But, with years of practice, or a particularly nice meditation, it becomes as natural as breathing.

It is only when the Mind is completely still and quiet, and the stream of consciousness has become still, that one can go within, and experience their true nature - a pure awareness that exists above and beyond all perception, sensation, thought, feeling, and memory.

And the more you reflect on the nature and origins of this pure awareness, where it has come from, how  it arises, where it goes...you come closer and closer to the truth.

"May all beings realize the ecstatic transparency of their own minds." 
- Karma Lotsu

"If you observe well, your own heart will answer;
Who realizes what? That is realization." 

/	/	/	/	/

When you compare yourself to someone else, what happens to your conception of yourself? 

You begin to see yourself and the people around you as better in some ways, worse in others.
You begin to criticize and pass judgement - and this is the root of many dangerous delusions.

Most compare themselves to others in the belief they can improve themselves that way, that they can correct their faults, and present a better version of themselves to the world.

We often look to each other to know that we are right or wrong, and in doing so we become set in our ways, predictable, mechanistic, mediocre.

The blind can lead the blind, but to what destination?

How does one improve upon what is already perfect?

How can you become your most authentic self by emulating others? 

What happens to your unique talents, gifts, and potential, when you take yourself for granted?

In order to fully understand who and what you are, what you are capable of, 
the comparisons and delusions must end.

You are what you are, nothing more, nothing less.

No one is higher or lower than anyone else - we are all here for a reason.

To live on the words of others, to be guided and compelled by beings, forces, circumstances and situations outside of ourselves, to allow all these influences to shape us, instead of shaping ourselves, is to live a hollow and meaningless life.

When you realize that you alone are responsible for yourself, for what you think, how you feel, and the way you act, it either brings despair and self-pity, bitterness and cynicism, or an awakening.
You can live however you please, and life can be a grand adventure, an endless unfoldment, a never-ending journey towards a destination that will always be just out of reach, until the day you suddenly arrive.

Your perception of what reality is all about changes as you progress along the path; with greater understanding comes greater compassion, acceptance, and ability to see the Divine Plan, even in your failings, and the shortcomings of others


/	/	/	/	/	/	/


"Reality is simply the loss of ego. 
Destroy the ego by seeking its identity. 
Because the ego is no entity, it will automatically vanish, and reality will shine forth by itself." 
- Ramana Maharshi

"As long as you think someone is doing something, you are still caught on the Wheel." 
- Buddha

"I had seen things in myself that I had never seen before; there could be no doubt about it, and although I afterwards became as I had been before, I could not help knowing that this had been, and I could forget nothing" 
- Ouspensky

"You're standing on a bridge, watching yourself go by..."


Those who fail to distinguish what is is essential from what is inessential, or falsity from truth, suffer.

You are not your Mind, or the thoughts that arise. 

You are watching, observing, the inner reality and the outer reality, and how the two interact and play off of one another.

As you become more Aware of this, you begin to identify less and less with your stream of consciousness, and more so with the Awareness itself.

Of course, thoughts will never stop appearing; the nature and purpose of the Mind is to continually find and invent stimuli, to exist within a cycle of discovery-analysis-understanding, even if the reality it is exploring is imagined or illusory. 

If we operate under the fallacy that, in order to become realized beings, we must cultivate 'Good' Thoughts and ignore and suppress our 'Bad' Thoughts, we will end up in an endless conflict against ourselves, one another, and the world around us.

Stop giving your thoughts, impulses, and opinions so much power.
Break your identification with your own thoughts, and you are close to achieving inner freedom.
Where do thoughts come from? Whence do they arise? How am I capable of watching them appear and disappear?
How is it that I can think of nearly anything I desire, and yet it is so difficult to think of nothing at all?

Just as a potter shapes a vessel to perfection, so does a wise person shape their mind.
As rain comes through a poorly-thatched roof, desires and lies fall into the undeveloped mind.

How much of "who you are" is simply a story you have been told, and continue to tell yourself?
Do you realize that your personality, your life story, your attractions and aversions, are like a finely-crafted mask?
You are not that; you can claim it, or change it as you please. Your life, who you are, what you do, can change in a day.
And yet, if you are not that - what are you?

What are you searching for? What are you trying to find, and why?
When you go out in the world, when you talk to others, do you act out of desire, attempting to impress your will?
How much validation do you need from others?

With realization of your inner awareness, the ego slowly falls away, and you realize that validation, satisfaction, lasting peace can only come from within - it cannot be attained by any means.
To search for these things in other people, or in the world around you, is to live a life of perpetual disappointment and suffering.

And so, we come to the work of understanding one's self, of healing ourselves, and looking for our inner light.
It is as difficult as it is necessary, and the process can easily take lifetimes.

It requires patience, tolerance, and above all, total awareness, without the comforts of delusion and denial. 

You must look at the best and worst parts of yourself with compassion and understanding, without hesitation or judgement, and come to understand who you were before you were born, and who you will be after you die - and what you will do with the moments in between.

You must live before you can truly die; and you must die before you can truly live.

Our bodies belong to our Mother; we were born of her, and to her we return.
Our minds belong to this plane, and all minds are connected;
The thoughts, words, and acts we have committed echo forever, in one way or another.
Your soul, your spirit, your essence, your true self and awareness, 
exists beyond the body and the mind, beyond life and death, beyond space and time. 
Embrace your true self - what you were, what you are, what you will be.



PEACE MUST BE FOUND WITHIN; THERE IS NOTHING OUTSIDE OF YOU THAT CAN TEACH YOU ABOUT YOURSELF. THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE GREAT OCEAN IS A JOURNEY INWARDS

There is nothing outside of you that can teach you about yourself;
There is no one you can talk to, no book you can read, no place you can go, no song you can listen to, no drug you can take, that will not show you what wasn't there already. 

All these things will do, is show you a reflection of yourself.

gradually you become aware of the inevitable process of the evolution of consciousness; the cloud of illusion becomes thinner, until there is nothing but light

if you go far enough in, you can see karma, patterns, of which our own life is only a small part, but in order to do so you must leave time and space; you can't think in time and space, you can't be in your thoughts!

get out, and you can see your entire life, before, and after..

see beyond attractions and repulsions, polarities and dualities; the journey across the great ocean is a journey inward, ever deeper, closer towards truth

we have gone out, and found much, but it is still not enough; go inward and you reach enlightenment, and true fulfillment

only when you truly see the divine in yourself and others do you liberate everyone involved

we must study ourselves, go beyond ourselves, learn from all things, become enlightened by all things..
Free yourselves from the limitations of body and mind, and leave no trace.

Consciously or unconsciously, our minds are always seeking something, searching, grasping, striving, imagining.

This has been our great blessing, and our greatest curse.

Our thoughts and beliefs are the wellspring of good and evil, fear and hope, the source of our greatest discoveries and achievements, and the root cause of our most terrible and destructive mistakes.

Awareness is the the dividing line, the mirror's edge.

A small child handling a knife is likely to hurt itself, or something else;
With experience and maturity, they become capable of using a knife in a hundred different ways.

There are many people in the world with more powerful tools than knives, and less maturity than a child - and we wonder why the world looks the way it does.

All knowledge and power must be tempered with awareness, mindfulness, intention, foresight, patience, selflessness, and clarity of purpose.

In the hands of unaware, ignorant, deluded, neglectful, short-sighted, impatient, and covetous people, knowledge and power has always led	  to death and suffering. 

Our Mind is the source of art, music, culture, science, history;
Our Mind is also the source of war, slavery, oppression, and cruelty.
All that is Good and Evil in this world is brought forth from the human heart.

Our world is a reflection of who we are - and if we wish to change the world, we must begin by changing ourselves.

You and I are responsible, not only for our own actions, but for one another.

"If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other..." 
- Mother Theresa

"I know not; am I my brother's keeper?"
- Cain



The mind takes the shape of what it reflects on most.

You are pure by nature; only your thoughts and beliefs are impure.
You alone are responsible for your words and acts.

By one's self is evil done, by one's self is one made impure.
By one's self is evil undone, by one's self is one made pure.

Devotion to divinity leads one closer to divinity;
Devotion to satisfaction, chasing after desires and ambitions, makes one base.

Do not dwell on guilt, shame, or regret; do not hold onto grief and anger.
Awareness of your errors means you can correct it; 
To practice humility is to return without straying far.
Suffering is a waning shadow, and what is left in its passing is knowledge, strength, and self-mastery.

Holding on, decieving and deluding yourself and others, will keep you trapped.
Only acceptance, surrender, and honesty will set you free.
The heart of a truly conscious person is fearless;
Free of desire and aversion, they have transcended good and evil.

Each person is responsible for themselves, and no one else. 
No one else can save another- we are all one and the same. 
The best thing you can do for others is to work on yourself.
The master cannot take a single step for their student.

Impurity is an illusion, a veil, under which your real nature has become hidden. 
But the essence of who you are, the real you, is already perfect.

Clarity over obscurity - clear the dust from the mirror, and let the light shine in.

AWARENESS 
___________________________

"All is Mind; work with no distractions."

Awareness leads to knowledge and power.

Awareness and gratitude are the keys to creativity.

Only by becoming aware of an issue can you begin to correct it.

All comparisons and divisions are mistaken assumptions.

Each cell within the body has its own consciousness

"Mind is the forerunner of all actions.
All deeds are created by the mind.
If one speaks or acts with a corrupt mind, suffering follows.
If one speaks or acts with a serene mind, happiness follows.

Those who fail to distinguish what is essential from what is nonessential, will, in having wrong views, fail to attain the essential.

As rain pours through badly thatched houses, so does desire fall into the undeveloped mind.


There is blindness all around, only a few can see.
Only a dfew escape and achieve liberation.


While all things are stirring together, contemplate the Return; for flourishing as they do, each will return to its origin.

TO return to the root is to find peace;
To find peace is to fulfill one's destiny;
To fulfill one's destiny is to become constant, like a star in the sky;
To become like a star is called Insight.

If one does not, they run blindly into disasters.


"Be done with learning, and you will no longer be vexed.


As to foreknowledge, it is only the flower of Tao, and the beginning of folly.


"One who knows does not speak; one who speaks does not know.

"To realize that our knowledge is ignorance, is a noble insight.
To regard our ignorance as knowledge, is a mental illness.


"In ancient times, those who were well versed in the practice of the Tao did not try to enlighten anyone, but rather to keep them in a state of simplicity.

Why are the people hard to govern? Because they are too clever!

One who governs a state with cleverness does it no benefit, one who governs a state with simplicity is its benefactor.

To know these principles is to possess a rule and measure, to keep the rule and measure in your mind is what we call Mystical Virtue.

Deep and far reaching is Mystical Virtue; it leads all things to return, til they come back into the Great Harmony!"

"you" are separate from the mind and body; there exists an "I" beyond Life and Death

"all that I knew, still wasn't enough"

"I had gone through game after game..still, people were looking into my eyes - 'Do you Know?'..'Do You?'..

"If a pickpocket meets a saint, they only see their pockets."

"If you wear shoes, the entire Earth is covered in leather."

you must live before you can die;
you must die before you can live;
do both with awareness!

what makes one unworthy is cowardice, avoidance of humility and shame; 
shame accepted is a great treasure;
the only thing that is humiliating is helplessness;
ignorance of your own error;
awareness of your own errors leads you closer to God.

Denial will only strengthen sin's hold over you; only awareness will destroy it

after the first realization, you never stop realizing - most are gradual subtle, some are sudden and impactful;
none can be forced into happening before it is time

adopt the role of the guru, the conscious being, who sees and understands all that you have done, and are doing now;
"You are the Eye that Sees, but not the Mind"
The Witness does not judge, simply notices and smiles;
The Witness does not care whether you Know or Not;
The Witness Knows how it all is.

Gradually, you become centered, and fear, shame, anger, fall away

we must study ourselves, go beyond ourselves, become enlightened by all things, free ourselves from our body and mind, and leave no trace

at first, a yogi feels as though their mind is like a waterfall, then like a river, then a calm ocean

there are no obstacles to meditation, aside from the thought that there are obstacles.

'a new type of thinking is essential' - Albert Einstein

emptying the mind is more important than the means of doing so

meditation, more than reflection and contemplation, is concentration, one-pointed focus, in order to still the mind before letting it go with no-thought, becoming empty.

let your mind wander, and watch it; see how it works, where it goes; focus on the rising and falling of your breath

don't try to suppress or get rid of thoughts, that only adds more thoughts on top of them. notice them, maybe label them, and move on.

as long as you think someone is doing something, you are still caught on the wheel - buddha

though your body and mind go through their natural dances, your awareness remains in the calm center of your heart, the here and now, where we all are

imagine a lake, with what you seek represented as treasure in its depths;
the surface is choppy, waves going in all directions; feelings and memories..
create a single thought, a single wave, that creates ripples, and keep going until that is the only wave.
Center your mind on this one thought.

thoughts do not stop;
we are not our thoughts;
we operate under the fallacy that we are our thoughts, and that we must attend to them in order to become realized.

to break identification with your own thoughts is to achieve inner freedom.

if you observe well, your own heart will answer

'who realizes what? that is realization' - hari dass baba

if you are fully present, you are capable of making the best possible decisions in the present, therefore creating a better future

let it be, let it go - later is later, now is now

living every moment as if it's the First Time

calm, meditation, is for remembering how everything is

My mind once wandered restlessly, wherever it chose, but now I hold it in check.

Meditate, and do not be negligent.


One who enters a bare room with a serene mind, contemplating the nature of all things, will experience trascendence.

Whenever one contemplates existence, they become filled with joy and happiness, deathlessness.

"When all the world recognizes beauty as beauty, this in itself is ugliness; when all the world recognizes good as good, this in itself is evil. 

Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth to each other;
Difficult and easy compliment each other;
Long and short exhibit each other;
High and low set measure to each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Back and front follow each other.

'you cannot teach a hunter it is wrong to kill' - hari dass baba

people see the world through their own perspectives and experiences, and so it's hard to convince them that 'new' things are in every single moment.

'I had seen things in myself that I had never seen before; there could be no doubt about it, and although I afterwards became as I had been before, I could not help knowing that this had been, and I could forget nothing' - Ouspensky

"Mindfulness is the path to immortality,
Negligence is the path to death.

With this understanding, those who are wise rejoice in mindfulness.

The awakened ones, dedicated to meditation, attain Nirvana.

Embrace each moment, live in blissful awareness, unconcerned with the past, the future, or with problems in the present, that always resolve themselves.

"Just as a potter shapes a vessel to perfection, so does a wise person shape their mind.

A harnessed mind brings great happiness.
A wise person should pay attention to their mind.
It is subtle, and wanders where it pleases.

One who cannot control their mind will never attain true wisdom, lives an imbalanced life, has wavering faith.

The heart of a fully conscious person is fearless.
Free of desire and hate, they have transcended good and evil.

what happens in the world helps you in meditation;
both are the same place

The truths of life cannot be communicated, only experienced.

return to the root and you will find the meaning;
pursue the light, and you will lose its source;

all come from mistaken views, there is no need to seek truth, only stop having views

listening stops with the ears, the mind stops with recognition, but the spirit is empty and accepts all things; the way gathers in emptiness alone; emptiness is the fasting of the mind; it is easy to walk, what is difficult is walking without touching the ground

may all beings realize the ecstatic transparency of their own minds - karma lotsu



no technology, no rules, no laws, nothing controlled by humanity can liberate humanity 

Change perceptions and beliefs of what is possible, and you elevate and expand the horizons of consciousness.

"Free your Mind, and Your Ass will Follow...
The Kingdom of Heaven is within."

Be critical of all teachings; search for your own truth.


Perception is Reality; unhappiness, discontent, disappointment, stem from our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, surrounding ourselves, others, and the world around us.

Our beliefs can either be our greatest source of suffering, or our greatest source of joy.


Each person is responsible for themselves.
No one can save another.

the mind takes the shape of what it reflects on most - devotion to divinity leads one closer to divinity

the rational mind is not enough

the major obstacle at every step is our own thoughts; thoughts keep us separate; the thought of unity is very different from true unity.

all thoughts add to the illusion, when we reach the shore, we must leave the boat behind.


we worship rationality, logic, and science over spirit;
if you think you are free, you cannot escape your prison

'If you set foot upon the path, you begin to see it everywhere' - Hermes T.

At first, sadhana is limited, in time and space - church on sunday, getting high on saturday - then, it becomes everything you do.


Let go of what has passed	
Let go of what may come
Let go of what is happening now
Don't try to figure anything out
Don't try to make anything happen
Relax, right now, and rest

Knowledge leads to unity, but Ignorance to diversity.
Reality is simply the loss of ego. Destroy the ego by seeking its identity. Because the ego is no entity it will automatically vanish and reality will shine forth by itself. - Ramana Maharshi

Impurity is a mere superimposition under which your real nature has become hidden. But the real you is already perfect, already strong.

Hold to the idea, "I am not the mind, I see that I am thinking, I am watching my mind act," and each day the identification of yourself with thoughts and feelings will grow less, until at last you can entirely separate yourself from the mind and actually know it to be apart from yourself.

It is our own mental attitude which makes the world what it is for us. Our thought make things beautiful, our thoughts make things ugly. The whole world is in our own minds. Learn to see things in the proper light. First, believe in this world — that there is meaning behind everything. Everything in the world is good, is holy and beautiful. If you see something evil, think that you are not understanding it in the right light. throw the burden on yourselves!


No book can teach you about yourself, no psychologist, none of the professors or philosophers. What they can teach you is what they think you are or what they think you should be.

Please let us be clear on this point — that you cannot by any process, through any discipline, through any form of meditation, go to truth, God, or whatever name you like to give it. It is much too vast, it cannot possibly be conceived of; no description will cover it, no book can hold it, nor any word contain it. So you cannot by any devious method, by any sacrifice, by any discipline or through any guru, go to it. You must await it, it will come to you, you cannot go to it. That is the fundamental thing one has to understand, that not through any trick of the mind, not through any control, through any virtue, any compulsion, any form of suppression, can the mind possibly go to truth. All that the mind can do is be quiet but not with the intention of receiving it. And that is one of the most difficult things of all because we think truth can be experienced right away through doing certain things. Truth is not to be bought any more than love can be bought.

To understand oneself requires patience, tolerant awareness; the self is a book of many volumes which you cannot read in a day, but when once you begin to read, you must read every word, every sentence, every paragraph for in them are the intimations of the whole. The beginning of it is the ending of it. If you know how to read, supreme wisdom is to be found.

What can a human being do — what can you and I do — to create a completely different society? We are asking ourselves a very serious question. Is there anything to be done at all? What can we do? Will somebody tell us? People have told us. The so-called spiritual leaders, who are supposed to understand these things better than we do, have told us by trying to twist and mould us into a new pattern, and that hasn't led us very far; sophisticated and learned men have told us and that has led us no further. We have been told that all paths lead to truth — you have your path as a Hindu and someone else has his path as a Christian and another as a Muslim, and they all meet at the same door — which is, when you look at it, so obviously absurd. Truth has no path, and that is the beauty of truth, it is living. A dead thing has a path to it because it is static, but when you see that truth is something living, moving, which has no resting place, which is in no temple, mosque or church, which no religion, no teacher, no philosopher, nobody can lead you to — then you will also see that this living thing is what you actually are — your anger, your brutality, your violence, your despair, the agony and sorrow you live in. In the understanding of all this is the truth, and you can understand it only if you know how to look at those things in your life. And you cannot look through an ideology, through a screen of words, through hopes and fears.
You cannot depend upon anybody. There is no guide, no teacher, no authority. There is only you — your relationship with others and with the world — there is nothing else. When you realize this, it either brings great despair, from which comes cynicism and bitterness, or, in facing the fact that you and nobody else is responsible for the world and for yourself, for what you think, what you feel, how you act, all self-pity goes. Normally we thrive on blaming others, which is a form of self-pity.

It's no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.

(A jīvanmukta, literally meaning 'liberated while living', is a person who, in the Vedānta philosophy, has gained complete self-knowledge and self-realisation, and attained kaivalya or moksha, and is thus liberated while still alive.)

For the simple reason that, consciously or unconsciously, the mind is always seeking something, and that very search brings violence, competition, the sense of utter dissatisfaction. It is only when the mind is completely still that there is a possibility of touching the deep waters.

The fact is there is nothing that you can trust; and that is a terrible fact, whether you like it or not. Psychologically, there is nothing in the world that you can put your faith, your trust, or your belief in. Neither your gods, nor your science can save you, can bring you psychological certainty; and you have to accept that you can trust in absolutely nothing. That is a scientific fact, as well as a psychological fact. Because, your leaders — religious and political — and your books — sacred and profane — have all failed, and you are still confused, in misery, in conflict. So, that is an absolute, undeniable fact.

Throughout life, from childhood, from school until we die, we are taught to compare ourselves with another; yet when I compare myself with another I am destroying myself. In a school, in an ordinary school where there are a lot of boys, when one boy is compared with another who is very clever, who is the head of the class, what is actually taking place? You are destroying the boy. That’s what we are doing throughout life. Now, can I live without comparison — without comparison with anybody? This means there is no high, no low — there is not the one who is superior and the other who is inferior. You are actually what you are and to understand what you are, this process of comparison must come to an end. If I am always comparing myself with some saint or some teacher, some businessman, writer, poet, and all the rest, what has happened to me — what have I done? I only compare in order to gain, in order to achieve, in order to become — but when I don’t compare I am beginning to understand what I am. Beginning to understand what I am is far more fascinating, far more interesting; it goes beyond all this stupid comparison.

Man has throughout the ages been seeking something beyond himself, beyond material welfare — something we call truth or God or reality, a timeless state — something that cannot be disturbed by circumstances, by thought or by human corruption. Man has always asked the question: what is it all about? Has life any meaning at all? He sees the enormous confusion of life, the brutalities, the revolt, the wars, the endless divisions of religion, ideology and nationality, and with a sense of deep abiding frustration he asks, what is one to do, what is this thing we call living, is there anything beyond it?
In this constant battle which we call living, we try to set a code of conduct according to the society in which we are brought up, whether it be a Communist society or a so-called free society; we accept a standard of behaviour as part of our tradition as Hindus or Muslims or Christians or whatever we happen to be. We look to someone to tell us what is right or wrong behaviour, what is right or wrong thought, and in following this pattern our conduct and our thinking become mechanical, our responses automatic. We can observe this very easily in ourselves.
For centuries we have been spoon-fed by our teachers, by our authorities, by our books, our saints. We say, "Tell me all about it — what lies beyond the hills and the mountains and the earth?" and we are satisfied with their descriptions, which means that we live on words and our life is shallow and empty. We are secondhand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment. We are the result of all kinds of influences and there is nothing new in us, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves; nothing original, pristine, clear.

We are afraid of the known and afraid of the unknown. That is our daily life and in that there is no hope, and therefore every form of philosophy, every form of theological concept, is merely an escape from the actual reality of what is. All outward forms of change brought about by wars, revolutions, reformations, laws and ideologies have failed completely to change the basic nature of man and therefore of society.
- Jiddu Krishnamurti


In samadhi, when meditating on an object, only the object of awareness is present, and the awareness that one is meditating disappears.

Samadhi is of two kinds, Samprajnata Samadhi, with support of an object of meditation, and Asamprajnata Samadhi, without support of an object of meditation.
Samprajnata Samadhi, also called savikalpa samadhi and Sabija Samadhi, meditation with support of an object, is associated with deliberation, reflection, bliss, and I-am-ness.
Savitarka, "deliberative"; the citta is concentrated upon a gross object of meditation, an object with a manifest appearance that is perceptible to our senses, such as a flame of a lamp, the tip of the nose, or the image of a deity.

Conceptualization (vikalpa) still takes place, in the form of perception, the word and the knowledge of the object of meditation. When the deliberation is ended this is called nirvitarka samadhi 
Savichara, "reflective"; the citta is concentrated upon a subtle object of meditation, which is not perceptible to the senses, but arrived at through inference, such as the senses, the process of cognition, the mind, the I-am-ness, the chakras, the inner-breath (prana), the nadis, the intellect (buddhi).

The stilling of reflection is called nirvichara samapatti
Sananda Samadhi, ananda, "bliss": this state emphasizes the still subtler state of bliss in meditation
Sasmita: the citta is concentrated upon the sense or feeling of "I-am-ness"
Asamprajnata Samadhi, also called Nirvikalpa Samadhi and Nirbija Samadhi, is meditation without an object, which leads to knowledge of purusha or consciousness, the subtlest element.

"The sage walks with heaven in life and evolves with things in death. In stillness, he shares the same integrity as yin; in movement, he shares the same current as yang. He is not the founder of fortune, nor is he the initiator of misfortune. He responds [應] when affected [感], moves when pressed, and arises only when he has no other choice. He rids himself of knowledge and precedent, conforming to the principle of heaven.

"To one who does not dwell in himself, the forms of things will manifest themselves. His movement is like water, his stillness is like a mirror. His response is like an echo [其應若響], indistinct as though it were absent, quiet as though it were pure."

Tao exists in invisibility; its function, in unintelligibility. 

Be empty and reposed and have nothing to do - 
Then from the dark see defects in the light. 

See but never be seen. 
Hear but never be heard. 
Know but never be known.

The stillness of the sages does not belong to them as a consequence of their skilful ability; all things are not able to disturb their minds - it is on this account that they are still. 

When water is still, its clearness shows one's reflection.
It  is a perfect Level, and the greatest artificer takes his rule from it.
 
Such is the clearness of still water, and how much greater is that of the human Spirit! 

The still mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the reflection of all things.
Vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action - this is the Level of heaven and earth, and the perfection of the Dao and its characteristics. 

Therefore the Dis, Kings, and Sages found in this their resting-place. 

Resting here, they were vacant; from their vacancy came fullness; from their fullness came the distinctions (of things). 

From their vacancy came stillness; that stillness was followed by movement; their movements were successful. 

From their stillness came their non-action. 
Doing-nothing, they devolved the cares of office on their employ, Doing-nothing was accompanied by the feeling of satisfaction.

Where there is that feeling of satisfaction, anxieties and troubles find no place; and the years of life are many.

- Practice mindfulness, self-reflection, and living in the present moment.
- Find peace and contentment by moderating your emotions and desires.
- Aim to live in a relaxed and effortless state.
- Accept the consequences of your choices without regret.
- Let go of expectations.
- Peace, joy, and understanding come from within. Do not seek them outside of yourself.
- Do not mourn for the past, worry about the future, or anticipate troubles.
 -Live in the present moment, and be grateful for everything.
- deep contemplation, meditation, and spiritual rituals and actions to maintain balance and connection
- mindfulness and intention in all areas of life
- accepting responsibility for our own actions
- become aware of the the current state of affairs
- be aware of individual and collective actions and karma
- release yourself from the illusionary and ego-centered aspects of your personality
- truth of life was not something to be known, but something to be experienced
- truth can only be found through our own exploration, and not through any single teaching


Sahaja means spontaneous enlightenment in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist spirituality. 

Sahaja practices first arose in Bengal during the 8th century among yogis called Sahajiya siddhas.
Ananda Coomaraswamy describes its significance as "the last achievement of all thought", and "a recognition of the identity of spirit and matter, subject and object", continuing "There is then no sacred or profane, spiritual or sensual, but everything that lives is pure and void.
The Sanskrit [and the Tibetan, which precisely follows it] literally means: 'born or produced together or at the same time as. Congenital, innate, hereditary, original, natural (...by birth, by nature, naturally...)'.[2]







Act without acting, speak without speaking, hear without being heard, see without being seen, know without being known.


Power moves, but is not moved.

Cunning is not intelligence, cynicism is not wisdom.

To set limits on yourself, or what is possible, is not rational, only foolish.

Ignorance and conceit are twins.


Reading a book is meditation; planting a seed is alchemy.

Every form, method, and teaching eventually reaches an end - transcend and go beyond them.

Mind over Matter; Right Thought

"You will give an account for every word spoken; in speaking, thy words are given power"


To become a perfect channel, one needs perfect method, and a deep desire.


Harboring negative thoughts keeps hatred alive, releasing them banishes hatred.

Animosity does not eradicate animosity.
Only by love and kindness is animosity dissolved.
This law is ancient and eternal.

There are those who are aware they are always facing death;
knowing this, they put aside all grudges and doubts.

One who lives for sensation and indulgence, temptation breaks, as strong winds break a frail tree.

One who lives mindfully, in self-control, moderate, devout, and energetic, cannot be tempted, just as wind cannot move a mountain.



Letting go of passion, aggression, and confusion, revering truth with a clear mind, not holding on to anything, brings the harvest of a holy life."

"Can there be joy and laughter when always the world is ablaze?
Enshrouded in darkness, should one not seek a light?

Look at the body, a mass of wounds upon a heap of bones, neither permanent nor enduring.

Shining truth and loving kindness live on.

How many lives, how many rounds of rebirth have I experienced, without finding the architect of this house?
Now I see you; all of your rafters are broken, the ridgepole shattered, never again need you build a house for me.

Those who do not find their way to a higher life, or who fail to earn fame and fortune in their youth, look back with regret in old age, like arrows that have missed their mark."

"Do not live carelessly. Do not prolong the suffering of the world.
Lift yourself up. Be attentive and virtuous.
Those who do good deeds and follow this path live happily, in this life, and those that come after.

See the world as a mirage, as a bubble. 
Look at Death with open eyes.

Look at the body as a boat that the ignorant cling to, even when they reach the other shore.

Light up the world like the moon coming from behind a cloud.


Those closed off from generosity will never enter the realm of the gods.
Better than dominion over this world, all worlds, over the heavens, is control of self, and the fruition of the path.

"The path is the best of ways, the best of truths.
Freedom from desire is the best of states.
Whoever lives with a clear mind and an open heart is counted among sages.

There is the one and only Way, there is no other path.

Following this path, you put an end to yours and others' suffering.
Having realized the way, I have shown it to you.

You yourselves must walk the path; we can only show the way.

All things are subject to change, are unsatisfactory, insubstantial.
When one realizes these truths, this is the way to purification.

The lazy one, weak in discipline, apathetic, unproductive, never finds the path.

Restrain your speech, control your mind, commit no evil deeds.
By these means, begin to walk the path laid out by the sages.

Wisdom is born from meditation.
Make the choice to walk where wisdom grows.

Cut down the entire jungle of desire.
Not an isolated tree, not a few clearings.

Cut off the love of ego with your own hands, as you would a flower.

"I shall live here in the summer, and here in the winter" muses the fool, unaware of the presence of Death.

Death carries a fool away while they are still busily acquiring wealth and children, like a rampaging flood engulfing a sleeping village.

When death comes, no one can offer refuge or escape.
Aware of this, behave well, and do not postpone what is right.
Clear the path to Nirvana."

"Become a knower of the uncreated.

Of what avail is the matted hair, and animal hides?
Within you is a forest of defilements; you deal only with the outside.

Whoever has no desire, for either this or another world, who is detached, and unbound, having liberated themselves from doubt through awareness, who has embraced the infinite, who has gone beyond the desire to do good or evil, free of sorrow, immaculate and pure, all longing for existence extinguished, they do I call a Noble One.

Whoever is beyond clinging, of past, present and future, who possesses and desires nothing, is released from this and all worlds."




jiddu krishnamurti notes

(if we wish to save humankind, and salvage or repair what we have done to the planet,
then the human mind must be saved and salvaged, as it's the origin and cause of our problems, and their solutions.)

the brain itself is losing its quality, its quickness, its perceptibility, its sensitivity, its capacity to think objectively, sanely, and rationally, not according to any philosopher, however clever, or any particular political division, left right or center, nor can the politicians solve this problem, nor the scientists, the biologists, the economists, the gurus and the various priests.

It is fairly obvious for an observant, thinking person to realize none of these will solve our problems.

And, as we said, we have to enquire,
and a skeptical inquiry into the nature of man,
the psychological and intellectual world,
the investigation of all that through skepticism,
never believing anything, nor following or obeying anyone,
except the laws, of course, if you don't pay taxes, you'll be held up -
but there is so much corruption regarding the laws of all that,
corruption has become a way of life.

seeing all this, that no philosopher, no politician, no organized group can ever solve this problem of human existence, which is now degenerating...which has become corrupt, 
which lacks utter integrity,
then there is no spirit of co-operation, naturally from all this,
we have great disorder in our lives, in our daily life and the societies within which we live,
our societies being our relationships with each other,
in which there is a great deal of pain, anger, anxiety, loneliness, and all the rest...


last time we met here we talked of order and disorder,
disorder is caused by thought itself,
thought is the origin of the patterns within which we live,
and the orders, disorders, and divisions between us, between nations, between sciences and religions, all this indicates a great deal of disorder, which eventually leads to war

and observing all this, we enquire - what is the cause of all this?
why, after all these millions of years of time, have we come to this low existence, why?

we like to say these disorders are caused by all kinds of fantastic things, but it's caused by our own consciousness, and we don't like to admit it. our consciousness is disordered, confused, and it reflects onto the world and relationships around us.

knowledge, which we have acquired through experience, stored as memory in the brain,
from which arises thought and action, this is the chain in which we are caught;
experience, knowledge, memory, thought, then action...
we are together exploring into the cause of this present confusion, why we are declining so rapidly, physically, mentally, and morally, and of course, in all this, there is no love..

desire is not love.

thought itself is the cause of this confusion.

words are not the thing;
the name is not the person.
in enquring, we must be very careful about words,
knowing that words are never the thing, that explanations are not the actualities.

so as our brain is caught in a verbal structure, because to us, words mean a great deal;

we must be careful that we are not examining words, or symbols or abstractions, but actual observations, so that our brain is acting, not coming to conclusions ( so it can be done with the whole affair )


/	/	/	


knowledge is set in the past; and is therefore incomplete;
and anything that is made from that knowledge is therefore incomplete

beliefs and ideals divide man;
thought is responsible for everything marvelous, extraordinary, terrible, and destructive that we have done

in some areas, it lifts up life, in other areas, it destroys it

this knowledge which we have acquired through our senses, which is passed down to us, and then to our children..
is now being passed to the computer...

it is programmed the same as we are, to be what it is.

your brain is programmed whether you like it or not, and you must observe and understand it

your brain has been cultivated through time and through knowledge and experience,
and through this cultivation has been conditioned, to respond to the world in a certain way

the computer is becoming your brain, the human brain,
the computer plus the robot, are already operating in manufacturing things, like cars, all kinds of things are happening in 10, 15 years, many of you will be unemployed.
you have to face all this, society is going to be turned upside down.
it is coming, whether you like it or not, and it's at your door.

your brain, which has been so extraordinarily capable, suffering inumerable sorrows, lives in great anxiety, frightened and insecure; the whole psychological world, which is the result of thought, 
that thought, is all being transferred to the robot and the computer.

do you understand how serious this all is? I do not know if you do.

so man, then, what is he? you understand my question?
if the computer can do everything that you can do, it can learn, and connect, it can create and foresee,
what then, when it can do everything better, and faster?
then what is man? you understand all this?
The computer say I believe in God -
oh you people laugh, you don't see the seriousness of all this, happening to all of us...
the computer can compose a poem, can compose, can diagnose, better than any doctor.
you understand?

and then we'll ask, what is man?

what are you?

if the machine can do everything, even better than you, what are you?

our brains have operated mechanically, right?
it believes, it doesn't believe, it creates its own gods and philosophies,
then what if a computer creates a philosophy, better than any philosopher?

so, what have we left? you understand my question?
if they can take over everything we can do, and do it better, then what is a human being, what are you?

your belief in god, your machine has a belief in god. 
it will do your rituals better than you can do,
it will invent theories better than any philosopher,
You understand all this?
so what have we left?

what we have left is - our psychological world.

my - our - sorrow, our fears, our pleasures, our anxieties, our immense loneliness...
do you understand all this? that is what we're going to be left with.
not with your gods...the gods have been invented by man, by thought.
you have shaped gods according to your desires and fears;
and computers can do all that.

what we are going to be left with, is time.
biological time, psychological time, and time as day and night.
that is what we're going to be left with.

and, biologically, time is necessary. it's part of genes.
genes also computerize within time;
they need time to grow physically.

and you have psychological time - hope, the future, the burden of the past, the fear of the unknown.
the immense, everlasting pursuit of pleasure;
and not only your own particular sorrow, but the collective sorrow of mankind, which you are.
this is what we're going to be left with.

right? please, I hope we are both together observing the same thing.
we must observe the facts, what is really going on, of which most of us are not even aware.
technology is advancing so rapidly...and everything that we human beings are doing now - going to the office, from 9 to 5, for the next 50 years - and education, given to students - you understand? - it's all going to be taken over, for god's sakes, realize...

so...

we are going to be left, with all our senses;
senses which create, which is the center of the brain;
and our senses either deteroriate gradually because we are only pursue pleasure;
and so we have to find out, what time truly means.

right?

the three times - biological, psychological, time by the watch - we can perhaps control or change biological time, which is happening even now in the world.
you can do nothing about chronological time.
psychological time, however, is the movement of thought in consciousness.
consciousness is made up of its content. right?
the computer has its conscience, because it's programmed to think this way, and that way, and respond rapidly, and so on, and that is what our own consciousness is. I wonder if you see the gravity of all this.

the accumulated beliefs, confusions, problems, superstitions, fears, nationalities, ideals, politics,
All that is our consiousness, which the computer is...you realize?

So, what are we going to do with our life? You understand?

Either, because we have time, leisure, and all the trouble which we take now to go to work, the computer and robot take over - then what is man going to do?

Either we will pursue pleasure and entertainment, distraction, even religious pleasures and entertainment, 
either you enter into all of this, and perhaps that is what will happen, because we live on entertainment, from books and movies and philosophies and religions, and so on...

Or -

You turn inward.

You understand? That's all that we have left.

Entertainment, or deep inquiry into one's self.
Enquiry into the psychological world, the senses, the fears, the pleasures,
whether there is any ending to sorrow, what is love...you understand?
What death means.

Because the computer will say, I believe in hereafter. You understand what I'm saying?

So together, let's go inward.

You understand what I'm saying?

Let us together examine whether there is an ending to fear, an ending to insecurity, not physical insecurity, because the computer may change the whole structure of society, as is happening already;

so we have only two things left to us, entertainment, or going deeply into world of the psyche, and going beyond.

the scientists, also, are becoming entertainers. 
like the priests.

you cannot possibly depend on scientists to salvage our inward state, nor the psychologist, nor the priest, there is nobody that can help us, except our own observation.

which doesn't mean that we become more and more selfish.

we are examining the human consciousness, the human brain.
your brain is not yours.
it is the brain of humanity, it has lived millions of millions of years.

in examining, investigating, through skeptical exploration,
We are examining not to become more mischevious and ugly, and more inwardly despicable, crooked, and corrupt,
We are examing, so that the brain, with all its activity taken over by the computer,
then we are investigating within nature, 
whether thought, which has created the psyche;
whether that thought which is time, can stop...

you understand? please follow.

thought is time. right? thought is the result of memory.
memory is knowledge and experience, stored in the brain;
therefore thought is a movement of time.

we are going to inquire very very deeply, whether there is a stop to time.

first of all, to observe, what is going on, inwardly, which is the result of senses, the various senses, centered in the brain, otherwise, you wouldn't react - so the center of the brain, is the accumulation of the senses, from which thought arises, which creates me and you, thought creates the individual;

thought and knowledge are incomplete, and therefore the concept of an individual is incomplete..
and there's no individual, because your brain is the brain of humanity,
your brain has evolved through millions and millions of years,
therefore you are not an individual, that is the first thing to realize -
it's illogical, it's not something invented by the speaker, you can see it for yourself if you examine it,
so the idea that investigating the psyche, you are becoming more and more selfish, or you're going to be saved -
this is not an individual salvation, it is the salvation of the human bein.


so first, as we said,
to learn the art of listening,
listening to yourself,
never distorting what you listen to.

that is, are you listening now, to what the speaker is saying, or are you distorting what the speaker is saying, to conform to your desires, or you say, tradition has already said this, which indicates you are not listening...

truly listen, without interruption, or prior conclusions

then, the art of seeing:

the seeing, without the word; seeing without seeing;
to see something, like a flower, and not name it, because the word prevents you from seeing it;
seeing by not bringing in previous memory within your perception;
if you want to see someone as they actually are, remove the image which you have created of them;
if you want to see your wife, not the physical form, or the pleasure thereof, but to see her as she is purely, that's an art. either you give - please listen - either you give time to learn the art, as you give time to learn anything else, and when you give time to the art of seeing, what have you done?
you haven't seen your wife at all...

to see without time, without previous conclusions, 
I wonder if you understand all this ...
this is necessary if you want to look into yourself, 
if you want to observe the entire psychological world, of which you are, 
in which there is no guide,
there is no priest or psychologist or therapist, you must watch yourself;
you have to learn the art of seeing and listening to yourself;
you see how your brain becomes extraordinary supple, sensitive, active...
and to see without the previous records that you have accumulated;
then memory is operating, not the sensory observation;

and finally, one has to learn the art of learning;
learning as we know it now, is merely the accumulation of knowledge,
which is purely mechanical;
you accumulate a language, or a mathematic or science, and then you know it and use it;
our brain is used to that, which is time;

is there learning without time?

which is, seeing instantly.

man is violent; probably inherited from the animal, but we will not get lost in the disputation of various causes;
there is no arguing however that man is violent.
now, when you say, I will be non-violent,
you are learning through time, to become something...or become not-something...

that is, your whole conditioning, psychologically, is to become something, if you are naughty, you become good, if you are angry, you hope not to become angry, and so on -
and we use time as a means to become something,
that's an operation, how a brain works...

now to see violence, and not change it to become something else...
but to see violence, or whatever you see in yourself that you do not like, 
take it and look at it.
you say, I will get over it, or I will transmute it, or I will surpress it or surpass it,
which are all movements within time, 
and in that time, other things will happen, which will likely prevent your changing

you see that, don't you?

that becoming, involves time, during that time you are learning to become something else,
which is, you are being programmed, by others or yourself, to change...

whereas there is a different way of learning -
which is, you are observing yourself,
and you've learnt something about yourself...

I am watching my greed, and I say, I must not be greedy, because I was told not to be, because it's bad, so I have to learn, restrain, control, surpress, and so on...

is there a different way of looking at greed? 
the word, the meaning, or is there a division of the word and the fact?

so I am watching, listening, what is greed?
and the brain is not going to become caught in the old system,
but seeing it as it is, and ending it instantly?
do you understand?

ending that which is observed, immediately, and finally.
see what happens.

Our brains have problems. Right?
Many problems, filled with problems.

And with every problem that arises, 
you try to solve it, on top of all the problems you have already,
and therefore nothing is solved;

the technological brain can solve problems,
but our brains, psychologically, are so full of problems,
there is never an end to these problems.

you are not learning anything from me, the speaker, you are learning from your own observation, therefore you are a dignified human being, depending on nobody...

to see greed, and end it;
so that your brain is not caught in time...
you get what I am saying?

you have your own particular little problem, look at it, don't try to verbalize it, or run away from it, just look at it..stay with it.

the moment you try to change it - you are caught in time.

but if you stay with it quietly, without movement of thought, you will see it is not. right?

so, there is the art of seeing, of listening, of learning;
with that, you approach yourself. right?
you approach yourself, which is the whole psychological world;
because the computer has taken over everything else;
so you are now watching yourself, which is watching the human consciousness, watching the human psyche, it is not your psyche, because no matter where you go in the world, human beings are suffering;
human beings have fear, pursue pleasure, are afraid of death, have no love;
so it is a common factor - the psyche is the common factor -
so you are the whole of humanity - you understand, sir?

deep down, psychologically, you are like the rest of mankind,
mankind that is lonely, mankind that is frightened,
mankind that is longing to escape from itself...
and burdenered with innumerable sorrows of a thousand years;
you are that.
you are the representative, you are the rest of mankind, the best of mankind,
you are mankind;
when we investigate, we do not investigate the particular little "me", which is only a part of humankind as a whole, 
there is nothing selfish in this, there is nothing to be saved,
this is not a religion of salvation we are talking about -
We are talking about the ending of fear.

Fear is the result of thought.

Fear is the result of Time;
fear of the past, and fear of the future.
actual fear has no time;,
only when thought says I am afraid;
fear is a sensory response, centered in the brain, and thought says I am afraid;
I am afraid of losing my job, my wife, and I am jealous, etc, 
all that is the movement of thought;
and all pleasure also, is the movement of thought;
pleasure of sex, of money, power, right?
pleasure of possession, in attachment, to people, places, ideas;
that attachment is corruption.
Yes sir.

Say you are attached to your wife or your child;
attachment can lead to thoughts that lead to suffering;
without them you feel lost, or lonely;
from that attachment arises anxiety, fear, jealousy, and so on;
so where there is attachment of any kind, there is a gradual corruption...

sir, do you see it?
the truth of it? 
the fact of it?
then end it!!

but if you say,
I'll think about it,
I'll learn about it,
why should I not be attached,
and back and forth, and so on,
you are back in the old system,
where time binds you...

I wonder if you understand this.

Our brains have become slaves to Time,
but if you see that,
you can End Time, which is Ending Thought...

Before we go into much deeper things,
in this you must be clear;
A brain, a psyche, that has no fear,
that is not constantly chasing pleasure, possession, power, siddhis, control of self and others, all these various forms of pleasure - to look at it, and see what it is;
to see and enjoy a sunset or beauty, is not pleasure,
but to say, I must see this again, or do this again, or bring others, and so on,
that is pleasure, a trap of the mind -
so see it and do it, instantly!

then we have to go into, also, into the very complex problem of sorrow;
whether there can ever be an end to sorrows;

passion, which has its own intelligence, and therefore its own action, 
but that passion cannot come into being, 
until you have understood, and ended sorrow...
