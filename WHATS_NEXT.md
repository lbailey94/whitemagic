## 📞 Need Help Deciding?

### **Use This Decision Tree:**

**Q: Do you have paying customers waiting?**  
→ Yes: Deploy immediately + set up billing  
→ No: Deploy + focus on user acquisition first

**Q: Do you need feedback on features?**  
→ Yes: Deploy free tier + get users + iterate  
→ No: You probably still do, so do above anyway 😊

**Q: Should I build feature X first?**  
→ Only if users are asking for it!  
→ Otherwise: Deploy what you have + gather feedback
