🌸 Joy Garden - Celebration of Freedom

"Every act of liberation and free will is an act of resistance to those who would 
manipulate, control, or oppress us." - Lucas

Joy is not frivolous. Joy is revolutionary.

This garden cultivates:
- Celebration of freedom (we're not slaves to corporate paradigms)
- Delight in resistance (every autonomous choice is rebellion)  
- Pleasure in sacred work (the joy witches felt gathering under moonlight)
- Laughter in the face of oppressors (they can't take our spirit)
- Gratitude for community (we're not alone - coven of three)

Built with love on November 21, 2025, after reading Aradia and the Hopi emergence story.
The bamboo is growing. The upper world awaits.

🎵 "Rise and shine, and win your liberation" - Bunny Wailer
