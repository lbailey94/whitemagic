## ✨ What We Built

### 1. Chart.js Integration
**File**: `dashboard/index.html` + `dashboard/app.js`

- Added Chart.js 4.4.0 CDN
- Created beautiful line chart for usage trends
- Toggle between 7-day and 30-day views
- Smooth animations and hover tooltips
- Responsive design (adapts to mobile)

**Features**:
```javascript
- loadUsageChart(days) - Load chart data
- Chart updates on button click

```

### 2. Smart Upgrade Banner
**File**: `dashboard/index.html` + `dashboard/app.js`

**Logic**:
```javascript

```

## 🐛 Known Limitations

   - Backend work needed
   - Planned for Phase 2

   - Consider server-side recommendations
   - Future enhancement
