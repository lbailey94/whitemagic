## 💡 Strategic Considerations

### Why Keep v2.1.4 as "Complete"

1. **Clear Theme**: Developer Experience ✅
   - SDKs + CLI = complete developer toolkit
   - Clean, focused release

2. **Marketing Story**: Simple to explain
   - "v2.1.4 makes WhiteMagic 13x easier for developers"
   - Next: "v2.2.1 helps you manage and monetize usage"

3. **User Expectations**: No confusion
   - Developers got what they needed
   - Dashboard is clearly "next release"

4. **Momentum**: Ship often, ship small
   - Faster feedback cycles
   - More frequent wins
   - Better community engagement

### Why Dashboard Fits Better in v2.2.1

1. **Thematic Fit**: User-facing features
   - Dashboard is for end users, not developers
   - Pairs naturally with billing/monetization
   - Whop integration makes dashboard more valuable

2. **Scope Management**: Right-sized releases
   - v2.1.4 already has 2 major features
   - v2.2.1 needs an anchor feature
   - Dashboard works better with full monetization context

3. **Quality**: Time to do it right
   - Don't rush dashboard into v2.1.4
   - Better to ship excellent dashboard in v2.2.1
   - Can gather v2.1.4 feedback first
