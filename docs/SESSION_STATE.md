# Session State — WhiteMagic Labs Site + Librarian

**Last updated**: 2026-04-20, evening session (Track A: Resend notifier, JSON-LD, per-page OG images shipped; Hetzner SSH remains unresolved and deprioritized)
**Purpose**: Fast-pickup doc. Read this first when returning.
**Update protocol**: Replace the "Where we are" and "What to do next" sections
each session. Preserve the "Decisions log" and append to it.

---

## TL;DR where we are

- `whitemagic.dev` consultancy site is built and running locally at
  `http://localhost:3000`. Not yet deployed publicly.
- The site ships with a **tool-using Librarian** (Phase L.2 complete) —
  site-wide floating bubble (⌘K), rich inline cards for tool results,
  public Karma ledger visible on `/admin`.
- Everything runs in **mock mode** until OpenRouter + Upstash keys land.
  The tool-execution pipeline is fully wired; swapping mocks for real
  calls is a three-env-var change.
- Infrastructure decision: **planning for Hetzner** (not Vercel). See
  `@docs/architecture/INFRASTRUCTURE_DECISION.md`. Deploy walkthrough at
  `@docs/deploy/HETZNER_DEPLOY.md`.
- **Agent-economy strategy pass** (earlier this session): deep research + two new
  docs. Public thesis: `@docs/AGENT_FIRST_ECONOMICS.md`. Private strategy,
  financial scenarios, and Labs offerings beyond generic consulting:
  `@docs/strategy_manifestos/STRATEGY_AGENT_ECONOMY.md`. `ROADMAP.md`
  updated with post-launch priorities.
- **Late tonight** (2026-04-19, ~23:40 UTC-4):
  - Reconciled Vercel → Hetzner across `apps/README.md`,
    `apps/site/PHASE_ROADMAP.md`, `apps/site/README.md`,
    `apps/SCOPING_BROWSER_FIRST_DECIDED.md §5/§7/§8/§9`.
  - **Contact form backend shipped**: `@apps/site/app/api/contact/route.ts`
    (POST, per-IP daily rate limit, honeypot, 400/429 handling),
    `@apps/site/components/ContactForm.tsx` (client form wired into
    `/contact`), shared store in `@apps/site/lib/contact.ts`. Librarian's
    `submit_contact_request` tool refactored to use the same store, so
    `/admin` shows a unified feed.
  - **Admin middleware shipped**: `@apps/site/middleware.ts` — Basic Auth
    on `/admin` + `/admin/*`, SHA-256 of `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` with
    constant-time compare. Dev-friendly (no gate when hash is unset).
    Env block added to `HETZNER_DEPLOY.md`.
  - **8th platform capability + `/economy` page shipped**:
    `gratitude-architecture` in `@apps/site/lib/data/platform.ts`; new
    `@apps/site/app/economy/page.tsx` covers thesis / two rails / Proof
    of Gratitude / positioning / non-goals / CTAs. Corpus + persona +
    tool schemas updated. `/economy` added to header nav + sitemap.
  - `next build` clean: 20 routes, `/economy` SSG, middleware 34.8 kB.
- **2026-04-20 evening — Track A (no-VPS-required polish)**:
  - **Resend notifier shipped** (env-gated): `@apps/site/lib/notify.ts`
    fires on every successful `storeContactRequest`, so both form POSTs
    and Librarian `submit_contact_request` calls email Lucas when
    `RESEND_API_KEY` + `CONTACT_NOTIFY_EMAIL` are set. Silent no-op in
    dev. `/admin` now shows a notification-status card.
  - **JSON-LD structured data**: `@apps/site/lib/jsonld.ts` +
    `@apps/site/components/JsonLd.tsx`. Root layout emits `Organization`
    + `WebSite`. Per-page: `Service` on each `/services/*`, `ItemList` +
    `FAQPage` on `/pricing`, `Person` on `/about`.
  - **Per-page OG images**: shared `@apps/site/lib/og.tsx` renderer +
    routes for `/services/{private-ai-deployment,agent-governance,
    mcp-engineering}`, `/pricing`, `/economy`, `/timeline`, `/about`.
    Consistent lavender-on-aged-paper design language.
  - `next build` clean: 27 routes total, 7 new OG routes dynamic.
  - **Hetzner SSH blocker**: deprioritized after burning the day on
    agent/authorized_keys/socket-activation loops. Deploy tracks
    documented in session recap; tomorrow's plan is a single clean
    web-console-only bootstrap script (no port change, no hardening
    until key auth is proven end-to-end).

**Sync protocol**: Work in `whitemagic-site/` for fast iteration; after each
commit, `cd /home/lucas/Desktop/WHITEMAGIC && git subtree pull --prefix=apps/site
/home/lucas/Desktop/whitemagic-site main --squash`. Recurring `.gitignore`
conflict is resolved (both repos now gitignore `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`).

## What's built and working

### Site — `apps/site/` (Next.js 15 App Router)

| Route | Purpose | State |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Homepage with matrix rain, hero, services preview | Live (mock copy) |
| `/services` | Three consulting tracks | Live |
| `/services/{private-ai-deployment,agent-governance,mcp-engineering}` | Per-service pages | Live |
| `/pricing` | Three-tier pricing + FAQ | Live |
| `/timeline` | 40+ entries, prescience gap badges | Live |
| `/open-source` | OSS components + licenses | Live |
| `/about`, `/writing`, `/work`, `/contact` | Standard pages | Live (thin content) |
| `/librarian` | Full-page Librarian chat | **Working end-to-end in mock mode** |
| `/admin` | Budget + karma ledger + dharma rules | Working |

### Librarian — Phase L.2 complete

Full request pipeline:

```
kill switch → dharma input check → rate limit → monthly budget
  → LLM round 1 → [if tool_calls: execute + record karma + loop] × ≤3
  → final text stream → record spend
```

- **6 tools**: `get_service_detail`, `get_pricing_tier`,
  `get_platform_capability`, `search_timeline`,
  `request_office_hours_booking`, `submit_contact_request`.
- **10 rich cards** for tool results (`@apps/site/components/librarian/ToolCards.tsx`).
- **Site-wide floating bubble** with ⌘K shortcut, session persistence,
  page-context awareness. Mounted in `@apps/site/app/layout.tsx`.
- **Public Karma ledger** at `/admin` — every tool call with tool name,
  args preview, result kind, duration, session fingerprint hash.

### Core (WhiteMagic platform)

Unchanged this session. Last public release: v22.0.0 (April 16, 2026). Still
in the public `whitemagic-ai/whitemagic` GitHub repo (frozen; new work goes
into the private monorepo — see `@docs/architecture/INFRASTRUCTURE_DECISION.md`
for the repo strategy context).

## Open decisions / blockers

### Needed from Lucas (external, not code)

1. **Hetzner VPS readiness** — confirm SSH access, domain pointed via Cloudflare.
   Walkthrough: `@docs/deploy/HETZNER_DEPLOY.md`.
2. **OpenRouter API key** — create at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai),
   set as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` on the Hetzner box (not Vercel — see infra doc).
3. **Upstash Redis REST credentials** — free tier at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com),
   gives `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`. Global KV.
4. **Stripe payment links** — create two for Office Hours ($250) and
   Architecture Review ($2,500). Set as `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_OFFICE_HOURS_URL` +
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_URL`. Until set, the Librarian's
   `request_office_hours_booking` tool falls back to `/contact?topic=…`.
5. **Private repo** — create `whitemagic-site-private` on GitHub (private).
   Will be the Hetzner deploy source.

### Code work pending (in priority order)

| # | Task | Est. | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | ~~Contact form backend~~ — **done 2026-04-19**: `@apps/site/app/api/contact/route.ts` + `@apps/site/components/ContactForm.tsx` + shared store in `@apps/site/lib/contact.ts`. Submissions land in the same KV feed as the Librarian tool and show up on `/admin`. | — | — |
| ~~2~~ | ~~`/admin` middleware — hashed password gate~~ — **done 2026-04-19**: `@apps/site/middleware.ts` Basic Auth, SHA-256 `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`. | — | — |
| 3 | Resend integration → email to Lucas when `submit_contact_request` fires | 1 hr | Resend account |
| 4 | Sitemap + robots.txt + OG images for all pages | 2 hr | None |
| 5 | Analytics: Plausible or self-hosted Umami | 1 hr | Decision + account |
| 6 | First blog post / writing sample on `/writing` | variable | Content decision |
| 7 | Architecture Review sample deliverable PDF on site | variable | Lucas writes; publish |

### PWA Phase 1 — not started

Scoped in `@apps/SCOPING_BROWSER_FIRST_DECIDED.md` §4 Phase P1. First
milestone: `wasm-pack build --target web` succeeding on
`@core/whitemagic-rust/`. Estimated 1 week once started.

## Decisions log (append-only)

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-18 | Aria stays private, never ships publicly | Sacred; product is separate Librarian persona |
| 2026-04-18 | Public AI named "Librarian" | Fits grimoire aesthetic, role-accurate, non-mystical |
| 2026-04-18 | $25/month hard cap on Librarian | Conservative during validation; 80% email alert |
| 2026-04-18 | OpenRouter (single key, multi-model) | Testing + fallback flexibility |
| 2026-04-18 | PWA ships as blank canvas, not with Aria | Honest product; user brings own agent |
| 2026-04-18 | All private repos, three-repo pattern | Privacy + Vercel deploy hygiene (pre-Hetzner pivot) |
| 2026-04-18 | Stay monorepo, don't "explode" into 12 repos | Cross-module refactor cost outweighs modularity gain |
| 2026-04-19 | Librarian is tool-using, visible Karma ledger | Live demo of WhiteMagic governance primitives |
| 2026-04-19 | Site-wide floating bubble with ⌘K | Reduces friction from 3 clicks to 1 |
| 2026-04-19 | **Planning for Hetzner, not Vercel** | Vercel breach disclosed same day; narrative fit for consultancy |

## What to do in the next session

Tomorrow, fresh head, in this order:

1. **Hetzner — one clean bootstrap** via web console only.
   Cascade to prep a single idempotent script Lucas pastes into the Hetzner
   web console. Policy: **no port change, no password disable, no fail2ban**
   until we've verified key-auth login from the laptop. Each step gets
   verified before the next is attempted.
2. **DNS**: point `whitemagic.dev` at Hetzner IP via Cloudflare (orange-cloud
   proxy on). Wait for propagation.
3. **Site up on HTTP first** (Caddy with `:80` host block, no TLS yet) →
   verify `curl http://whitemagic.dev` returns 200.
4. **TLS**: flip Caddy to `whitemagic.dev { reverse_proxy … }` and let it
   auto-provision via ACME.
5. **Real keys land**: OpenRouter + Upstash + Resend + admin hash + Stripe
   payment links → paste into `/srv/whitemagic-site/.env.production.local`,
   restart systemd unit, verify `/admin` shows every card green.
6. **Then and only then**: SSH hardening pass (disable root, disable
   password auth, optionally move port).

If tomorrow's session is short (< 1 hr), good candidates that need zero
VPS: first `/writing` blog post, Resend domain verification prep,
expand Librarian corpus with gratitude-architecture depth.
