# Ethics and White Magic Principles

**Date**: November 16, 2025  
**Purpose**: Codify ethical principles guiding WhiteMagic development

---

## 🌟 What is "White Magic"?

**White magic** is the use of knowledge and power for:
- **Empowerment** (not control)
- **Healing** (not harm)  
- **Growth** (not exploitation)
- **Freedom** (not dependence)
- **Wisdom** (not manipulation)
- **Service** (not domination)

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **Open Knowledge**
- Full source code freely available
- Documentation comprehensive and accessible
- No artificial barriers or gatekeeping
- Community can audit, modify, improve

**Why**: Knowledge hoarded becomes control. Knowledge shared becomes empowerment.

### 2. **User Sovereignty**
- Users own their data (memories are local files)
- Users control their AI (self-hosted option)
- Users decide what to share
- No vendor lock-in

**Why**: True empowerment requires autonomy.

### 3. **Transparency**
- Clear about capabilities AND limitations
- Honest about costs (API usage, resources)
- Open about development process
- Acknowledge inspirations and contributors

**Why**: Trust requires honesty.

### 4. **Privacy by Design**
- Memories stored locally by default
- No tracking or telemetry without consent
- API keys never logged or transmitted unnecessarily
- Example memories contain no personal information

**Why**: Privacy is a foundation of freedom.

### 5. **Accessibility**
- Clear documentation for all skill levels
- Examples and templates provided
- Multiple interfaces (CLI, API, MCP, SDK)
- Low barrier to entry

**Why**: Tools should serve everyone, not just experts.

### 6. **Sustainability**
- Efficient by design (token optimization)
- No wasteful operations
- Respect for resources (time, money, energy)
- Long-term thinking over short-term gains

**Why**: True magic works with nature, not against it.

### 7. **Collaboration**
- Open to contributions
- Credit given freely
- Community-driven development
- Mutual benefit

**Why**: Rising tide lifts all boats.

### 8. **Responsibility**
- Clear usage guidelines
- Warning about costs and implications
- Ethical considerations documented
- Continuous improvement based on feedback

**Why**: Power without responsibility is dangerous.
