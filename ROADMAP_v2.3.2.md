# WhiteMagic v2.3.2 Roadmap

**Status**: Planning  
**Target**: TBD  
**Focus**: Polish, Performance, Production-Readiness

---

## 🎯 Vision

Build on v2.3.1's Memory Evolution foundation with:
- Production hardening
- Performance optimization
- User experience improvements
- Community features

---

## 📋 Candidate Features

### 🔧 High Priority

1. **Evolution Dashboard** (Web UI)
   - Visualize pattern extraction results
   - Show evolution proposals
   - Interactive approval/rejection workflow
   - Progress tracking

2. **Memory Replay System**
   - Replay captured actions for debugging
   - Time-travel through decision history
   - "What-if" scenario testing
   - Session restoration

3. **Pattern Marketplace**
   - Share successful patterns with community
   - Import proven solutions
   - Rate and review patterns
   - Auto-update best practices

4. **Automated Testing Expansion**
   - Integration tests for memory system
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Regression test suite
   - CI/CD improvements

### 🚀 Medium Priority

5. **Meta-Memory Compression**
   - Archive old patterns intelligently
   - Lossy compression for ancient history
   - Keep essence, discard details
   - Configurable retention policies

6. **Cross-Session Learning**
   - Share patterns between users (opt-in)
   - Federated learning approach
   - Privacy-preserving aggregation
   - Community wisdom database

7. **Smart Notifications**
   - Alert on anti-pattern detection
   - Suggest optimizations in real-time
   - Evolution proposal notifications
   - Weekly wisdom digest

8. **CLI Improvements**
   - Better error messages
   - Progress bars for long operations
   - Interactive wizards
   - Tab completion

### 💡 Low Priority (Nice to Have)

9. **Memory Visualization**
   - Graph of knowledge evolution
   - Pattern relationship maps
   - Timeline view
   - 3D memory landscapes

10. **AI-Assisted Coding**
    - Use patterns to suggest code
    - Auto-fix anti-patterns
    - Generate tests from patterns
    - Refactoring recommendations

11. **Multi-Language Support**
    - Expand Rust core beyond consolidation
    - JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
    - Go, Java, C++ pattern extraction
    - Language-agnostic meta-learning

12. **Mobile Companion App**
    - View memory on phone
    - Quick pattern lookup
    - Voice notes → short-term memory
    - Push notifications

## 🎨 Proposed from v2.3.1 Evolution Analysis

Based on autonomous proposals generated:

1. **Implement automated error detection** (HIGH, 85%)
   - Pre-commit hooks for common errors
   - Pattern matching in CI/CD
   - 30-50% reduction in runtime errors

2. **Expand test coverage** (HIGH, 80%)
   - Integration tests for bug-prone areas
   - Focus on edge cases
   - 20-30% reduction in bugs

3. **Create performance optimization guide** (MEDIUM, 90%)
   - Document proven strategies
   - Best practices reference
   - Knowledge sharing

4. **Create solution pattern library** (MEDIUM, 75%)
   - Reusable utilities module
   - `whitemagic.utils.patterns`
   - Faster problem resolution

5. **Decision automation system** (LOW, 70%)
   - Rules engine from heuristics
   - Pattern matching + confidence scoring
   - Automated decision making

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 100+ users actively using memory system
- **Performance**: <100ms for pattern extraction
- **Quality**: 90%+ confidence in proposals
- **Community**: 10+ shared patterns
- **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage

---

## 🧪 Technical Debt

Things to clean up:

1. UTF-8 handling in Rust (remaining warnings)
2. Unused variable warnings
3. Memory consolidation performance tuning
4. Error handling improvements
5. Documentation expansion

---

## 🤔 Open Questions

1. Should we build web dashboard first or CLI improvements?
2. Privacy model for cross-session learning?
3. Storage format for long-term pattern archive?
4. Integration with existing IDEs (VSCode, IntelliJ)?
5. Pricing model for premium features (if any)?

---

## 📅 Tentative Timeline

- **Week 1**: Evolution dashboard (web UI)
- **Week 2**: Memory replay system
- **Week 3**: Testing + hardening
- **Week 4**: Documentation + launch

**Total**: 4 weeks (similar to v2.3.1)

---

## 💭 Notes for Future Versions

### v2.4.0 Ideas
- Real-time collaboration on patterns
- Multi-repo memory system
- Team analytics
- Enterprise features

### v3.0.0 Vision
- Full autonomous coding assistant
- Self-improving system
- Natural language queries
- Production-grade AI pair programmer
