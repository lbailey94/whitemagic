  - 4 resources: `memory://short_term/*`, `memory://long_term/*`, `memory://short_term`, `memory://long_term`
  - Works with Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Desktop
  - One-command installation via `npx`

#### Testing & Quality
- **34+ comprehensive tests** covering:
  - Core memory manager functionality (23 tests)
  - API endpoints and authentication (11 tests)
  - Database operations
  - Rate limiting
  - Whop integration
  - MCP server integration
- **100% test coverage** on critical paths

#### Documentation
- Reorganized documentation structure:
  - `docs/reviews/` - Independent review responses
  - `docs/phases/` - Phase completion documents
  - `docs/production/` - Deployment guides
  - `docs/development/` - Current development docs
  - `docs/guides/` - User guides
  - `docs/archive/` - Historical documents
- New guides:
  - `.env.example` - Environment variable template
  - `requirements-api-minimal.txt` - Clean production dependencies
  - `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive cleanup documentation

### Fixed

#### Critical Fixes
- **Database pool configuration** now properly handles SQLite vs PostgreSQL
  - SQLite: No pooling, `check_same_thread=False`
  - PostgreSQL: Pool size 20, pre-ping enabled
  - Prevents startup crashes on SQLite
- **API key validation** handles underscores in random part
  - Fixed: `split("_", 2)` instead of `split("_")`
  - Keys like `wm_prod_test_key_with_underscores` now work correctly
- **Method name corrections** in API endpoints
  - `/api/v1/consolidate` → `consolidate_short_term()` (was `consolidate_memories()`)
  - `/api/v1/stats` → builds from `list_all_memories()` and `list_all_tags()` (was `get_stats()`)
  - `/api/v1/tags` → `list_all_tags()` (was `list_tags()`)
- **Request state population** for middleware
  - `request.state.user` now properly set in `get_current_user()`
  - Enables rate limiting and logging middleware

#### Version Standardization
- **All version numbers standardized to 2.1.0**
  - `README.md`, `DOCUMENTATION.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
  - `whitemagic/__init__.py`, `whitemagic/api/__init__.py`
  - `whitemagic/api/app.py` (3 locations)
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - Eliminated version chaos (previously: 0.1.0-beta, 2.0.1, 0.2.0, 2.1.0)

### Changed

#### Project Organization
- **Root directory cleanup** (38 → 15 files)
  - Moved 6 test files to `tests/`
  - Moved 4 shell scripts to `scripts/`
  - Moved 4 review docs to `docs/reviews/`
  - Moved 4 deployment docs to `docs/production/`
  - Moved 7 daily logs to `docs/archive/`
- **API package structure** improved
  - `whitemagic/api/__init__.py` now exports all public APIs
  - Clean imports: `from whitemagic.api import app, Database, User, APIKey`
  - Version available as `whitemagic.api.__version__`

#### Dependencies
- **Removed deprecated/unused dependencies**
  - `aioredis` → Use `redis>=5.0.0` (includes async support)
  - Marked for future: `python-jose`, `passlib`, `sentry-sdk`
- **Created clean dependency list**
  - `requirements-api-minimal.txt` with only production deps
  - Clear TODO comments for future features

### Improved

- **ROADMAP.md** updated with accurate phase status
  - Phase 1A: All deliverables marked complete ✅
  - Phase 1B: Most deliverables marked complete ✅
  - Current: Phase 2A In Progress (API & Whop Integration)
- **API module importability** - proper `__all__` exports
- **Code formatting** - Applied Black formatter consistently

### Security

- **API keys never stored in plaintext**
  - SHA-256 hashing before database storage
  - Raw keys only shown once at creation
  - Secure key rotation mechanism
- **Rate limiting** prevents abuse
  - Per-user quotas
  - Redis-backed tracking
  - Plan-based limits
- **Request validation** with Pydantic models
  - Type safety on all endpoints
  - Automatic validation errors
